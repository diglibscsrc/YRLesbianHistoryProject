I don't know who did your research on Deborah Sampson, Revolutionary War
soldier, but she was neither a woman of color nor a lesbian. As a
relative, I
can attest to both. There are many strong and contributing women who have
also been Lesbians. 
It demeans and devalues your project to include people without
proper research. Deborah was a brave and noble woman who believed that the
battle against tyranny should not be limited by gender nor age. To this
extent, she was a "feminist", however her reproductive and social roles
following the war show her to not have been a lesbian.
Additionally, not all people called Sampson are "of color". Deborah's
heritage
is traceable to Governor William Bradford, who came on the Mayflower, and
to
Edmund Hobart, an early religious figure in Hingham, MA.
I would hope that your future research is better formulated than your
past. Dick Bucknum.

RESPONSE:
    </h4>
Deborah Sampson was the subject of a lesbian history column I write every
month for The Lesbian News. In it I discuss the issues of her ethnicity
and of her sexual orientation. A copy of the column is available at the
Lesbian Legacy Collection Archives in Los Angeles.

 I read with interest Dick Bucknam's letter regarding his relative Deborah 
 Sampson.  Aside from family antecdotes, Mr. Bucknam appeared to find his 
 proof of Ms. Sampson's heterosexuality in the reproductive and social
roles 
 she assumed.  I am constantly amazed when intelligent people fail to 
 recognize that sexual relations (and marriage) are entirely possible
without 
 passion.  Thank you for offering such an excellent list.  It's one of the 
 best I've encountered.

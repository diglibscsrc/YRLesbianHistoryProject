<center><h3>SUPPORT  INDEPENDENT  BOOKSTORES</h3></center>
<blockquote>
This photo shows the superstore's tactics in action.  By opening shop
directly across the street, chains can encroach on the existing clientel
that an independent has built up in an area.  When Borders moved in two
years ago, sales began to decline, and to this day we are struggling to
compete with the giant.

<p>
For twenty-two years, Sisterhood Bookstore has been taking a stand.  Now
we are asking you to stand with us.  <p>
Through all the years when womens's issues were "in" and through all the
years when they weren't, we have been here for you.  Although there are
periodic media announcements that women have at last achieved equality,
our oveflowing bookshelves, our crowded bulletin boards, and the posters
on our walls <em>tell a different story.</em>
We would like to be able to continue telling that story.  This is why we
are asking for your support.  Our sales have been down due in part to the
recession, the earthquake, and the proliferation of corporate owned chain
bookstores.<p>
Chain "superstores" have become a particular problem in recent years to
all independent bookstores.  While a chain store may carry some of the
same titles we do, perhaps at a lower price, profit is always their bottom
line, not the concepts and values in the books they are selling.  The
gender and lesbian studies section in a chain store will disappear the
moment it ceases to be profitable.  And that decision will be made
thousands of miles away at corporate headquarters.  Sisterhood Bookstore
is a community resource that stands up for women's and gay rights whether
or not it is popular to do so.<p>
<h4>Our commitment to empowering women will never take a back seat to the
profit motive.</h4>

<h2> FEMINISMS by C. T. MOORE et al </h2>
<br>
A variety of movements in feminism means that calling one's self a
feminist can mean many things.  In general, members of the following
categories of feminism believe in the listed policies; however as with
any diverse movement, there are disagreements within each group and
overlap between others.  This list is meant to illustrate the
diversity of feminist thought and belief.  It does not mean that
feminism is fragmented (although it often seems that way!).  Much of
the definitions presented here are inspired from _American Feminism_
by Ginette Castro; there is a definite American bias here.  Other
sources were _Feminist Frameworks_ (2nd ed.) by Jaggar and Rothenberg
(which is a worthwhile but incomplete reader that tried to sort out
these various schools of feminist thought).  Any additional, balancing
information from other countries and/or books is more than welcome
(and will be incorporated).
<p>
Defining various kinds of feminism is a tricky proposition.  The
diversity of comment with most of the kinds presented here should
alert you to the dangers and difficulties in trying to "define"
feminism.  Since feminism itself resists all kinds of definitions by
its very existence and aims, it is more accurate to say that there are
all kinds of "flavors" and these flavors are mixed up every which way;
there is no set of Baskin Robbins premixed flavors, as it were.
<p>
<h3>Amazon Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    Amazon feminism is dedicated to the image of the female hero in
    fiction and in fact, as it is expressed in art and literature, in
    the physiques and feats of female athletes, and in sexual values
    and practices.
<p>
    Amazon feminism is concerned about physical equality and is
    opposed to gender role stereotypes and discrimination against
    women based on assumptions that women are supposed to be, look or
    behave as if they are passive, weak and physically helpless.
<p>
    Amazon feminism rejects the idea that certain characteristics or
    interests are inherently masculine (or feminine), and upholds and
    explores a vision of heroic womanhood.  Thus Amazon feminism
    advocates e.g., female strength athletes, martial artists,
    soldiers, etc. [TG]
<p>
<h3>Anarcho-Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    Anarcho-feminism was never a huge movement, especially in the
    United States, and you won't find a whole lot written about it.  I
    mention it mostly because of the influential work of Emma Goldman,
    who used anarchism to craft a radical feminism that was (alas!)
    far ahead of her time.  Radical feminism expended a lot of energy
    dealing with a basis from which to critique society without
    falling into Marxist pleas for socialist revolution.  It also
    expended a lot of energy trying to reach across racial and class
    lines.  Goldman had succeeded in both.  Radical feminist Alix
    Schulman realized this, but not in time to save her movement.
    She's put out a reader of Goldman's work and a biography, both of
    which I recommend highly.  [JD]
<p>
<h3>Cultural Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    As radical feminism died out as a movement, cultural feminism got
    rolling.  In fact, many of the same people moved from the former
    to the latter.  They carried the name "radical feminism" with
    them, and some cultural feminists use that name still.  (Jaggar
    and Rothenberg don't even list cultural feminism as a framework
    separate from radical feminism, but Echols spells out the
    distinctions in great detail.)  The difference between the two is
    quite striking: whereas radical feminism was a movement to
    transform society, cultural feminism retreated to vanguardism,
    working instead to build a women's culture.  Some of this effort
    has had some social benefit: rape crisis centers, for example; and
    of course many cultural feminists have been active in social
    issues (but as individuals, not as part of a movement).  [JD]
<p>
    Cultural feminists can sometimes come up with notions that sound
    disturbingly Victorian and non-progressive: that women are
    inherently (biologically) "kinder and gentler" than men and so on.
    (Therefore if all leaders were women, we wouldn't have wars.)    
    I do think, though, that cultural feminism's attempts to heighten
    respect for what is traditionally considered women's work is an
    important parallel activity to recognizing that traditionally male
    activities aren't necessarily as important as we think.  [CTM]
<p>
    I have often associated this type of statement [inherently kinder
    and gentler] with Separatist Feminists, who seem to me to feel
    that women are *inherently* kinder and gentler, so why associate
    with men?  (This is just my experience from Separatists I know...I
    haven't read anything on the subject.)  I know Cultural Feminists
    who would claim women are *trained* to be kinder and gentler, but
    I don't know any who have said they are *naturally* kinder. [SJ]
<p>
    As various 1960s movements for social change fell apart or got
    co-opted, folks got pessimistic about the very possibility of
    social change.  Many of then turned their attention to building
    alternatives, so that if they couldn't change the dominant
    society, they could avoid it as much as possible.  That, in a
    nutshell, is what the shift from radical feminism to cultural
    feminism was about.  These alternative-building efforts were
    accompanied with reasons explaining (perhaps justifying) the
    abandonment of working for social change. Cultural feminism's
    justification was biological determinism.  This justification was
    worked out in great detail, and was based on assertions in
    horribly-flawed books like Elizabeth Gould Davis's _The First Sex_
    and Ashley Montagu's _The Natural Superiority of Women_.  So
    notions that women are "inherently kinder and gentler" are one of
    the foundations of cultural feminism, and remain a major part of
    it.  A similar concept held by some cultural feminists is that
    while various sex differences might not be biologically
    determined, they are still so thoroughly ingrained as to be
    intractable.  There is no inherent connection between
    alternative-building and ideologies of biological determinism (or
    of social intracta- bility).  SJ has apparently encountered
    alternative-builders who don't embrace biological determinism, and
    I consider this a very good sign. [JD]
<p>
    I should point out here that Ashley Montagu is male, and his
    book was first copyright in 1952, so I don't believe that it
    originated as part of the separatist movements in the '60's.
    It may still be horribly flawed; I haven't yet read it. [CTM]
<p>
<h3>Erotic Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    [European] This seemed to start (as a movement) in Germany under
    the rule of Otto von Bismarck.  He ruled the land with the motto
    "blood and iron". In society the man was the _ultra manly man_ and
    power was patriarchal power. Some women rebelled against this, by
    becoming WOMAN. Eroticism became a philosophical and metaphysical
    value and the life-creating value. [RG]
<p>
<h3> Eco-Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    This branch of feminism is much more spiritual than political or
    theoretical in nature.  It may or may not be wrapped up with
    Goddess worship and vegetarianism.  Its basic tenet is that a
    patriarchical society will exploit its resources without regard to
    long term consequences as a direct result of the attitudes
    fostered in a patriarchical/hierarchical society.  Parallels are
    often drawn between society's treatment of the environment,
    animals, or resources and its treatment of women.  In resisting
    patriarchical culture, eco-feminists feel that they are also
    resisting plundering and destroying the Earth.  And vice-versa.
    [CTM]
<p>
    This is actually socially-conscious environmentalism with a tiny
    smattering of the radical and cultural feminist observation that
    exploitation of women and exploitation of the earth have some
    astonishing parallels.  The rest of "eco-feminism" turns out to be
    a variation on socialism.  The Green movements of Europe have
    done a good job of formulating (if not implementing) an
    environmentally aware feminism; and while Green movements
    were not originally considered a part of eco-feminism, they
    are now recognized as a vital component. [JD]
<p>
    (If I remember correctly, a couple of feminist groups, including
    NOW have joined up with Green parties.  [CTM])
<p>
<h3>Feminazi:</h3>
<p. "invented"="" "nazi"="" (fetuses).="" -="" <p="" a="" abortions="" as="" by="" defines="" feminazi="" feminist="" group="" he="" hence="" host="" is="" limbaugh.="" many="" of="" particular="" people="" possible.="" produce="" radio="" rid="" rush="" sees="" term="" the="" them="" this="" to="" trying="" tv="" was="" who="" world="">
    This term is of course completely without merit, but there's the
    definition of it FYI.  [CTM]
<p>
<h3>Feminism and Women of Color:</h3>
<p>
    In _feminist theory from margin to center_ (1984), bell hooks
    writes of "militant white women" who call themselves "radical
    feminists" but hooks labels them "reactionary" . . .  Hooks is
    refering to cultural feminism here.  Her comment is a good
    introduction to that fractious variety of feminism that Jaggar and
    Rothenberg find hard to label any further than to designate its
    source as women of color.  It is a most vital variety, covering
    much of the same ground as radical feminism and duplicating its
    dynamic nature.  Yet bad timing kept the two from ever uniting.
    For more information you might want to also read hooks' book and
    her earlier reader, _ain't i a woman?_ Whereas radical feminism
    was primarily formulated by educated white women focusing on
    women's issues, this variety was formulated by women who would not
    (because they could not) limit their focus.  What is so
    extraordinary is that the two converged in so many ways, with the
    notable exception that the women of color were adamantly opposed
    to considering one form of oppression (sexism) without considering
    the others. [JD]
<p>
    I think an important work in the history of feminism and women of
    color is Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga's anthology, _This
    Bridge Called My Back: Writings By Radical Women of Color_.  It's
    my belief that the unique contribution of women of color, who
    experience at least two forms of discrimination daily, provides
    balance and reality to much of the more theoretical forms of
    academic feminism favored by educated white women.  [EE]
<p>
<h3> Individualist, or Libertarian Feminism:</h3>
<p> 
    Individualist feminism is based upon individualist or libertarian
    (minimum government or anarchocapitalist) philosophies, i.e.
    philosophies whose primary focus is individual autonomy, rights,
    liberty, independence and diversity.
<p>
<h3>  Lesbianism:</h3>
<p>
    There are a couple of points to make here.  First is that
    Lesbianism is not necessarily a *de facto* part of feminism.
    While it is true that merely being a lesbian is a direct
    contravention of "traditional" concepts of womanhood, Lesbians
    themeselves hold a wide variety of opionions on the subject of
    feminism just as their straight sisters do.
<p>
    On the other hand, Lesbianism has sometimes been made into a
    political point by straight women "becoming" lesbian in order to
    fully reject men.  However, it is never accurate to characterise
    all feminists as Lesbians nor all Lesbians as feminists.  
<p>
    The reader should also note that homophobia is as present among
    feminists as it is in any other segment of society.  Lesbianism
    and feminism, for all their common points and joint interests, are
    two very different groups.  [CTM]
<p>
<h3> Liberal Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    This is the variety of feminism that works within the structure of
    mainstream society to integrate women into that structure.  Its
    roots stretch back to the social contract theory of government
    instituted by the American Revolution.  Abigail Adams and Mary
    Wollstonecraft were there from the start, proposing equality for
    women.  As is often the case with liberals, they slog along inside
    the system, getting little done amongst the compromises until some
    radical movement shows up and pulls those compromises left of
    center.  This is how it operated in the days of the suffragist
    movement and again with the emergence of the radical feminists.
    [JD]
<p>
<h3> Marxist and Socialist Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    Marxism recognizes that women are oppressed, and attributes the
    oppression to the capitalist/private property system.  Thus they
    insist that the only way to end the oppression of women is to
    overthrow the capitalist system.  Socialist feminism is the result
    of Marxism meeting radical feminism.  Jaggar and Rothenberg point
    to significant differences between socialist feminism and Marxism,
    but for our purposes I'll present the two together.  Echols offers
    a description of socialist feminism as a marriage between Marxism
    and radical feminism, with Marxism the dominant partner.  Marxists
    and socialists often call themselves "radical," but they use the
    term to refer to a completely different "root" of society: the
    economic system.  [JD]
<p>
<h3> Material Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    A movement in the late 19th century to liberate women by improving
    their material condition. This meant taking the burden of
    housework and cooking off their shoulders.  _The Grand Domestic
    Revolution_ by Charlotte Perkins Gilman is one reference. [RZ]
<p>
<h3> Moderate Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    This branch of feminism tends to be populated by younger women or
    other women who have not directly experienced discrimination.
    They are closely affiliated with liberal feminism, but tend to
    question the need for further effort, and do not think that
    Radical feminism is any longer viable and in fact rather
    embarrassing (this is the group most likely to espouse feminist
    ideas and thoughts while denying being "feminist").  [CTM]
<p>
<h3> 'pop-feminism':</h3>
<p>
    This term has appeared several times on soc.feminism.  It appears
    to be a catch-all for the bogey"man" sort of feminism that
    everyone loves to hate: you know, the kind of feminism that grinds
    men under its heel and admits to no wrong for women.  It is
    doubtful that such a caricature actually exists, yet many people
    persist in lumping all feminists into this sort of a category.  [CTM]
<p>
<h3> Radical Feminism:</h3>
<p>
    Provides the bulwark of theoretical thought in feminism.  Radical
    feminism provides an important foundation for the rest of
    "feminist flavors".  Seen by many as the "undesireable" element of
    feminism, Radical feminism is actually the breeding ground for
    many of the ideas arising from feminism; ideas which get shaped
    and pounded out in various ways by other (but not all) branches of
    feminism. [CTM]
<p>
    Radical feminism was the cutting edge of feminist theory from
    approximately 1967-1975.  It is no longer as universally accepted
    as it was then, nor does it provide a foundation for, for example,
    cultural feminism.  In addition, radical feminism is not and never
    has been related to the Maoist-feminist group Radical Women. [EE]
<p>
    This term refers to the feminist movement that sprung out of the
    civil rights and peace movements in 1967-1968.  The reason this
    group gets the "radical" label is that they view the oppression of
    women as the most fundamental form of opression, one that cuts
    across boundaries of race, culture, and economic class.  This is a
    movement intent on social change, change of rather revolutionary
    proportions, in fact.  [JD]
<p>
    Ironically, this get-to-the-roots movement is the most root-less
    variety of feminism.  This was part of its strength and part of
    its weakness.  It was always dynamic, always dealing with
    factions, and always full of ideas.  Its influence has been felt
    in all the other varieties listed here, as well as in society at
    large.  [JD]
<p>
    To me, radical feminism is centred on the necessity to question 
    gender roles.  This is why I identify current "gender politics" 
    questions as radical feminist issues.  Radical feminism questions
    why women must adopt certain roles based on their biology, just as
    it questions why men adopt certain other roles based on theirs.
    Radical feminism attempts to draw lines between biologically-
    determined behavior and culturally-determined behavior in order
    to free both men and women as much as possible from their previous
    narrow gender roles.  [EE]
<p>
    The best history of this movement is a book called _Daring to
    be Bad_, by Echols.  I consider that book a must! [JD] Another
    excellent book is simply titled _Radical Feminism_ and is an
    anthology edited by Anne Koedt, a well-known radical feminist
    [EE].
<p>
    Radical feminist theory is to a large extent incompatible with
    cultural feminism.  The reason is that the societal forces it
    deals with seem so great in magnitude that they make it impossible
    to identify any innate masculine or feminine attributes except
    those which are results of the biological attributes.  (This is
    what I think the [above] "view[s] the oppression of women as the
    most fundamental form of oppression," [is getting at] although I
    don't agree with that statement in its context.) [DdJ]
<p>
<h3> Separatists:</h3>
<p>
    Popularly and wrongly depicted as Lesbians, these are the
    feminists who advocate separation from men; sometimes total,
    sometimes partial.  Women who organize women-only events are often
    unfairly dubbed separatist.  Separatists are sometimes literal,
    sometimes figurative.  The core idea is that "separating" (by
    various means) from men enables women to see themselves in a
    different context.  Many feminists, whether or not separatist,
    think this is a necessary "first step", by which they mean a
    temporary separation for personal growth, not a permanent one. [CTM]
<p>
    There is sometimes some overlap between separatist and cultural
    feminists (see below). [SJ]
<p>
    It is equally inaccurate to consider all Lesbians as separatist;
    while it is true that they do not interact with men for sexual
    fulfillment, it is not true that they therefore automatically shun
    all interaction with men. [CTM] And, conversely, it is equally
    inaccurate to consider all separatists Lesbians.  Additionally,
    lesbian feminism may be considered a category distinct from
    separatist feminism.  Lesbian feminism puts more emphasis on
    lesbianism -- active bonding with women -- than separatism does,
    in its emphasis on removing bonds with men. [EE]
<p>
[Other categories?  Both formal and informal are welcome.]

Times of Darkness: Norwegian Women's Encounter with Nazism [90
minutes-1995]
Karoline Frogner
A moving and essential contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust
and Nazi era, this inspiring film tells the rarely heard story of
women's survival and resistance in German-occupied countries. While
searing testimony and dramatic reenactments combine in a detailed
evocation of the past, candid scenes of the film's construction break the
narrative to skillfully question present-day representations of this
history. In intimate interviews, ten Norwegian Jewish and gentile women
share their experiences of deportation to concentration camps for
their political activities. Recalling how smuggling false papers, aiding
underground radio groups, and distributing illegal newspapers led to
their imprisonment, they impart the fear of having been caught and the
pride of having acted. As these courageous women describe enduring
interrogations and torture while pregnant and giving birth in prison, they
convey the incredible hardships faced specifically by women in the
camps. Articulating women's experience of occupation and imprisonment,
this moving film is an important record of resistance. Examining
the compassion and will that led these women to act, Times of Darkness
documents women's solidarity in the face of the German war
machine. As a historical record and tribute to remarkable courage, Times
of Darkness offers a stirring example of women refusing to
compromise their beliefs in the most difficult of circumstances. Winner of
the Norwegian National Prize for Best Documentary;
The Norwegian Amanda for Best Documentary; the Nordic Glory Grand Jury
Prize; and the Women's Film Festival
of Torino Best Documentary Prize. The Jewish Society of Norway planted
trees in the Norwegian Woods in the director's honor. [Source: Northern

life lines of endurance, hence of existence itself."

diameters of duraluminum rings [for V-2 missiles]. We measured and
mismeasured millions of them. Churchill once acknowledged that the
sabotage...prevented many V-2 missiles from exploding over London."

<h3>NAKED LADIES</h3>
<p>
Estimadas Chicleras, -os:
<p>
	I don't know what a deconstructionist looks like so I don't know
what to
make of Don Octavio's recent attempt to express his vision of a distinct
Mestizo Literature and criticism. I confess my Eurocentric bias but unlike
Romano I don't see that this bias misinfluences one's assessment of
Chicano
Literature. I think it not reasonable to fault one's Eurocentrism when
this
forms the heart of the Chicano experience, ie we know ourselves in light
of
the other. Maybe this deconstruction stuff explains this (hasta en
frances)
but I don't have the faintest idea. 
<p>	
I second Romano's call for critical liberation for chicano letters from
standard academic tools, or whatever is de modo. All this because, having
just finished Alma Luz Villanueva's 1994 __Naked Ladies_ (Tempe AZ:
Bilingual
Press / Editorial Bilingue), I'm not sure what he wants me, a male reader,
to do
about this story, nor that it should be approached as an example of
Chicano
Literature.
<p>
	_Naked Ladies_ is well-crafted and interesting. Villanueva tells
an
intensely personal story marked with sex, violence, love, motherhood,
coming
of age, mortal danger from men. You couldn't get away with the book's hot
sex
scenes in High School, nor its homosexuality, but any reader would find it
worthwhile reading because it features a strong chicana lead, a
multicultural
cast, and stresses the urgency for women of being decisive enough to act
sooner rather than later and to mistrust men. For a man that's a
chastening
message but good advice nonetheless.
<p>
	What puzzles me is me. Women and men need Alta's ethos -- her
ability to act
using all her available power, from running down a mugger to shotgunning
two
rapists. Kick ass, Alta. Role model, Alta. To a male reader she's the
image
of who "your" woman could become, whether you like it or not, so lead,
join,
or get out of her way. Unless you're Alta's The Perfect Male friend -- and
this is the part that leaves out this reader, for one, perhaps all men.
There
apparently exist two types of men in Alta's world, evil and Perfect.
Villanueva doesn't allow me an alternative, and I fit neither profile. I
feel, in fact, defensive for men when almost every man you meet turns out
to
have been sexually abused as a child or is himself a child abuser, rapist,
wife abuser, adulterer or any combination thereof. Villanueva's pretty
relentless in this so the pattern is inescapable.
<p>
	_Naked Ladies_ offers a two part story. Part One traces Alta's
liberation.
We watch as Alta sheds one burden after another. Whether by choice or by
circumstance, each crisis leads inevitably to that day in her life that
she's
the remaining survivor of her past self, and she has to begin again. She's
20
something, no skills, two kids, no job, no scholarship, no husband. In
all,
as part two ends, Alta's free at last.
<p>	
More people should meet Alta. For instance, consider the reader's first
glimpse of Alta in the book's opening pages when Alta runs down the
elegant
purse snatcher and realizes the absolute power she has,how readily she can
defeat a man:
<p>
		And the woman, Alta could hear as she quickly rolled down
her window, was
saying, "Let go of me, you fucker," in a steady, angry voice.
	Within that silent universe there was only one choice: run him
over: now.
Right now.
		The wheel turned without effort, and Alta's aim was
perfect. The beautiful
panther-man wasn't expecting this, and his face registered shock and pain
as
the front 	bumper caught his strong, lovely legs. He'd dragged the
woman
halfway down the street. Now he let her go and his eyes connected to
Alta's.
<p>
	Villanueva's introduced a chicana who defines her life for
herself. Yet,
Chicanisma isn't nearly as great a concern in Alta's life as being a woman
and mother. Villanueva gives all her characters an ethnic identity. Alta
and
April, the lead women characters, along with Jackie and Rita, are Latina,
Jade is Asian and Navajo, April is dark like her mother, but her father,
Hugh, along with Katie, Doug, Cheryl, and Bill are Anglo. Michael and
Steve,
Alta's best male friends, are black. Yet ethnicity itself keeps its place
in
the background of the relationships, so the absence of chicano or Latino
men
Alta's life, and her noted preference for black men, is unremarkable.
Still,
I wish Villanueva'd created a Perfect Chicano, instead of Michael.
Further,
Alta expresses her ethnic identity in several ways, the allusion to
grandmother's wisdom, a casual remark like, "Do you want some more coffee,
loca?" But while Alta hears familiar chicano voices of protest, she feels
more vitally moved by her awareness of womanhood:
<p>
		An intense sorrow and longing filled Alta; so intense she
almost lost
consciousnesss for a moment. It was the child's pain. "Yes." She saw her
hunger, the shame of 	her poverty, the color of her skin, the sound of
her
Spanish being ridiculed publicly in a five-year-old's memory, and an
Indian
language her grandmother spoke sometimes 	flickered like a vauge,
comforting
dream that left her desolate because she could never remember, never
remember, never remember. 
<p>
	Then Alta remembered the cries of her mother, the defense of her
mother, the
betrayal of her mother, the longing for her mother. Her mother. Her
longing
for a father had stopped at eight, and now she craved only a mother. 146 -
7 
Personal satisfaction and sexual identity define Alta's values, not the
cultural or ethnic focus on chicanismo. One might even argue the work is
not
a work of Chicano Literature at all, but of a different genre, feminist
lit,
whose author simply happens to be chicana.
<p>	
Part Two jumps forward to 1999, a critical year in Alta's as yet unlived
new
life. Her two closest women friends are dead, she's divorced from the
interim
husband (inherited from her first dead friend), Alta's ex, Hugh,came fully
out of the closet and has died of AIDS. The kids are grown and living
their
own good lives, Alta is rich enough to live in rustic surroundings, employ
an
apprentice. Since we last saw her, Alta's completed her degree, begun a
successful counseling practice, settled into a deeply satisfying
heterosexual
relationship with her apprentice.
<p>	
Interesting woman, Alta. But the successful and completely in control Alta
you know from part two is only a possibility -- 1999 hasn't happened yet,
nor
the seeming perfect ending: Alta finds two true Loves, a good man in
Michael,
a wounded Jade to be loved and healed.  Want to meet a Perfect Man?
Michael, Alta's apprentice and lover. Sensing Alta's love for Jade, and
feeling only a bit jealous, Michael offers a strenuous seduction of his
own, sending Alta to new amorous heights. 
<p>	
Jade, on the rebound from a failed relationship, has been gang raped and
accepts Alta's and Michael's counsel. Michael is Alta's student become
Perfect Male Lover. Jade's view of being woman has become twisted by the
vicious rape: "Twice, during the night, she'd sat bolt upright at a
harmless
sound, but nothing was harmless anymore. Nothing had ever been harmless,
she
realized. Being a woman is being raped as a child and being raped as a
woman,
and the killed if it suited them. 202
<p>
But Michael and Alta believe their ad hoc outdoor summer solstice ritual
might provide therapy Jade desperately requires. Alta may entertain her
own
motives because she loves both Michael and Jade and Alta's keenly aware of
Michael's own enhanced sexuality in competition with Jade. Psychedelic
mushrooms, wine and group sex contribute to a satisfying ritual and all
seems
well with mutual love and respect glowing among the three. Remember,
though,
this is all imaginary in 1999. Villanueva doesn't want a happily ever
after ending yet, so she brings back Ray and Jim, Jade's two cracker
rapists seeking revenge and blood:
<p> 
		Jim chuckled at the Sunday school brag. In fact, they both
went to church
nearly every Sunday, and if they didn't their wives and kids did. The
people
in the church 	blamed _those feminist bitches_ for causing trouble. They
said
those words inwardly; outwardly they said, "some folks just like to 'cause
trouble, women like that..." 	263
<p>
	Ray feels a strong gang rape-based camaraderie with Jim: "Yes,
that first
time. Sloppy seconds, then sloppy eights. Makes a guy feel closer ta his
buddies. Like me an' Jim's tight now." Jim, however, draws the line at
one's
own children, unlike Ray:
<p>
		"You ain't messin' with your own kids, are you?"
		Ray laughed loudly. "Ya takes stuff way too serious, Jim
boy. Ya jus' be
breakin' 'em in for mankind, the way I see it."
		"Does your old lady know?"
		"She knows an' she knows what's good fer 'er. Put the fear
a God in 'er
right away. Ahm the man, ain't I?" 265-6
<p>
	Alta hears this from cover and must watch helplessly as Jade and
Michael
become hostages. Just as Ray is about to rape Jade and Jim can't keep his
hands off Michael's genitals, Alta repeats her act of will and power from
the
first pages of the book. Alta shoots and kills Jim, to save Michael, then
kills the fleeing Ray, a clean shot in the back at a running target. In a
culminating irony, we learn in the final pages that Alta, having just
killed
two men (one of whom, we learn, was raped by his father from age two to
five),
is pregnant and her male child has just formed a barely distinguishable
penis. 
<p>
	Curious ending. Men who think with their dicks -- and most do --
are the
enemy. But men are sons of mothers like Alta, so why do they turn out like
Ray and Jim or Hugh and Doug? Why aren't more men like Alta's son, or
Michael? Villanueva puts this responsibility squarely in the woman's
hands,
as if to say this Alta's is the only road to this type of idyllic future.
Be
decisive; take action; it's a woman's world if she wants it.
<p>
	But what about me?

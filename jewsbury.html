<h3> Geraldine Jewsbury</h3>
Below find evidence for why so many women have stayed in the closet.
<br/>
We think of letters like this as part of the woman's history.
<br/>
What would Mr. Jewsbury have done with Geraldine Jewsbury's letters to
Jane
Carlyle?

<p>
I recently was "surfing the web" and came across your list of famous
lesbians. I would like for you to please provide the documentation of
this or remove our family name from the list. Who cares if someone
famous was gay or not. The work produced is all that matters in the
long run right? The self gratifying nature of your list is offensive
to me and to my entire family. If the there is evidence of a gay
relationship had by my Ms. Jewsbury, I assure you that she would have
preferred it to have been private. I await your response.
</p>
<p>
<b> RESPONSE:</b>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Tom Jewsbury:
</p>
<p>
As noted in the 
preface to the notables lesbian list, we only list women
whose names have appeared in reputable print sources or on reputable web
lists. Reputable is of course, in the eyes of the beholder. Letters of
concern such as yours motivate me to delve more deeply into the information concerning a
specific woman and her reputed or acknowledged lesbian or lesbian-like history.
</p>
<p>
I am happy to provide basic references for you. More detailed information
is done on a for fee basis.
</p>
<p>    
See the following sources for specific information on her
"intimate"  relationship with Jane Carlyle
and specifically Geraldine's own letters to Jane. 
</p>

1.The Gay and Lesbian Literary Heritage, Henry Holt publisher, p 242-243.
</p>
<p>    
2. Lesbian Lists, Alyson Publications, p. 23 
</p>
<p>    
3. Frontiers Journal v.4, #3, 1979 (M. Cruikshank) p 60-64
"Geraldine Jewsbury and Jane Carlyle." 
</p>
<p>   
I will suggest to
you that since heterosexuality requires no proof of physical intimacy,
the same standard can apply to lesbian and lesbian-like women. One reason
for creating a list of notables is that for too long those who are
threatened by female independence and love (of all types) between women,
have censored and denied such information. Secrecy was the norm due to
social opprobrium. In these relatively more enlightened times,
we encourage the presentation of the whole person. <br/><br/>
P.S. 
</p> 
Your letter raised several questions among those who saw it:
<p>
1. You say you were surfing the net and found Geraldine's name.
Her name will not readily appear on a list of results if you type in
Jewsbury or Geraldine Jewsbury on
Yahoo and other search engines. This led someone to wonder whether you
have a specific interest in lesbian history and/or you had some
information about Geraldine's history, which led you to our
site. 
</p>
<p>  
2. Another person noted your e-mail address as being senate.gov.
Re your query, they wondered whether you were conducting official
government business or personal business on an e-mail account paid
for by tax-payers. [Jewsbury's e-mail address is linked to the office
of Tom Inhofe, Republican Senator from Oklahoma].

<b> UPDATE: </b>
</p>
<p>   
From: The Times-Picayune, June 21, 1999:

<p>  
"The always holier-than-thou Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., was in such a
righteous huff over President Clinton's executive appointment of a gay
man as ambassador to Luxembourg that Inhofe asserted senatorial privilege
to block all other Clinton appointees, and never mind the damage to
U.S. interests... 
<b> Meanwhile, technicians trying to puzzle out why the computer system in
Inhofe's office was being balky discovered it was engorged with
pornography three of the senator's staff had downloaded from the
Internet..." </b> (bolding mine).
<br/><br/>
Hmmmmm... According to his e-mail address (see above) Mr. Jewsbury is
somehow affiliated with that senator's office.

Remind me never to tangle with you :-)

I was searching for Sophia Jex-Blake and came across your site (which
means, BTW that the poor sod {whoops} may really have been searching on the name.
<br/>
Out of curiosity to see what sorts of objections you got, I read his and
your riposte.
<br/>
Verdict: unkind, but just.

I was looking for a link to the Times Picayune (New Orleans newspaper
referenced in your rebuttal of Tom Jewsbury's request that his kinswoman's name be removed
from your list of famous lesbians) and took a moment to read your rebuttal of request for
anonymity. 
</p>   
Brilliant !  Absolutely brilliant ! 
<p> 
If there were more people like yourselves "standing at the portals of
thought" (Science &amp; Health,
by Mary Baker Eddy), we would be much better off. 
</p>
<p>    
With four daughters and a firm belief in the importance of "all inclusive
love", I can only wish
you success and God speed in rooting out sexual hypocrisy in north
America.

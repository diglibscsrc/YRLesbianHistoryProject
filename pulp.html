<h2><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY OF TEXTS ABOUT LESBIAN PULP NOVELS OF THE 50s and
60's</b></h2>

Author's Note: This is not an exhaustive bibliography on the subject. It
only 
contains the texts for which I had complete bibliographical data. Wide 
surveys of lesbian literature such as Jeannette Foster's Sex Variant Women 
in Literature  or Bonnie Zimmerman's The Safe Sea of Women  generally have 
at least a few paragraphs about pulp novels; the same goes for 
socio-historical surveys such as Lillian Faderman's Odd Girls and Twilight 
Lovers or John D'Emilio's Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities. Because the 
space given to pulp novels is minimal in these books, they are not 
included here.

This morning between 6 am and 6:30 am Ruth drifted off in her sleep.  She
was
very peaceful.  We're very grateful that she was able to go the way she
had
always wanted:  at home, with friends, without a lot of hoopla.
<p>
You can see her obit in the Detroit Free Press:

Hands as soft as silk,
weave welcome twining
between our rough fingers.
She wears her gifts
wrapped inside tiny warm arms,
embracing us in love.
<p>
She hold us when we walk,
lets us believe we support 
bones too frail to step alone.
But she is the anchor in each step.
She holds the sky in place,
guiding us to the dance.
<p>
Witness to a century,
survivor of its crude hatreds,
recorder of our memories,
she gathers each moment
into a bouquet of flowers,
pressing them into her soul.
<p>
She wonders why fame comes,
what deserving lies in a woman
whose life seems so simple.
She has climbed no mountains,
created no monuments, cast 
few ripples on the pond of life.
<p>
But she is the monument 
we need most of all.
When she enters our spaces,
all that is good in us
rises to meet her loving embrace.
She heals our crippled hearts.
<p>
We remember who we can be,
in a simple twining of fingers,
bouquets of loving souls,
alive to dance and ripple every pond.

 Remembering Ruth
<br/>
Nancy Melke
<p>
It is difficult to imagine the lesbian community here in metro Detroit
without Ruth Ellis. For me, she has
always been a part of its fabric. I was coming out at about the same time
Ruth (then in her
seventies) connected with the local community. One of the first meetings I
attended included Ruth
sharing her own coming out story.
 <p>
Though I did not know her well, over the years we would run into one
another -- at lesbian events, on
the downtown streets near her home. And I would hear of her through
friends, the local gay/lesbian
media.
<p>
Ruth was always warm, funny, friendly, energetic. She was a link to a
piece of lesbian history that I
found nowhere else, and she shared it generously with us all.
 <p>
After 101 years, Ruth Ellis was ready to move on; and I wish her a journey
as remarkable as her life.
 <p>
I feel grateful to have known her just a little, grateful for the history
she shared. And I'll miss her.

 Ruth and GOLDEN THREADS
<p>                     
Our beloved Ruth DID attend the 14th Annual GOLDEN THREADS Celebration
this 
past June 22-25, 2000  in Provincetown , lovingly referred to as "P'town", 
and she danced again with so many of us.  One of the most beautiful scenes 
was when she was dancing with America's famous drummer, Ubaka Hill.  It
was 
truly touching.  But that was our, Ruthie...loving, giving and truly 
touching.  These characteristics among so many others are what made her
our 
icon.
<p>
     It was blessed that Ruth, in passing, passed away peacefully in her 
sleep.  I can imagine now that one of her many greatest fans, Christine 
Burton, the founder of GOLDEN THREADS is smiling with Ruth right now!  
<p> 
    We all have our "most" beloved memories of being with Ruth and for
the 
rest of my life I know that mine is monumentally the most beloved for me, 
because Ruth was a most important part of my marriage (my commitment 
ceremony) at the Provincetown Inn on June 25th, 2000 at 11 A.M. when my 
darling Judy became my wife.  Ruth gave us the special "rose" for our
life's 
long-lasting commitment and she blessed us in this unification of two 
becoming one.  I learned then how much she loved us and on my way to Japan
in 
August at my stop-over at the Detroit airport when I phoned Ruth, she
first 
asked of my wife Judy and then lovingly referred to our wedding again.  
<p>
 Our love will always be with Ruth as it was while she was on this
earth.  
Her presence has given us all strength in her beauty.
<p>     
In Sisterhood,

I feel privileged that Ruth called me 'her favorite comic' and that she
always smiled broadly and held out her arms to me when she saw me! The
love
and respect that I feel for Ruth cannot be expressed in words...for each
time that I felt the loneliness of being one of the few 'prominent' black
women on the festival circuit, I would think of Ruth...and just the
thought
of her and knowledge of her story and her struggles would enable to don
the
cloak of forbearance and continue on.  Ruth, you will always live in my
heart.  Keep laughing...and keep dancing!"
<p>  Much love, Karen Williams

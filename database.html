<h2>NOTABLE LESBIANS OF ALL COLORS (LIST)</h2>

<p>
** NOTE/DISCLAIMER: 
<br/> What is a lesbian is always a question...
<br/>
Some of the women on this list were/are
lesbian-identified (closeted and not);
<br/>
others were/are
bisexual, "romantic friends," "lesbian-like," or "lapsed lesbians."
<br/>
Some were cross-dressers or
passing women, and some Amazon-like queens whose orientation has not been
unequivocably determined. 
We encourage further research on any 
woman listed. <p>

** The information found on this list comes from printed and
online sources and we are not responsible for errors in those sources.
<p>
** We do receive communications from people unhappy about someone being on
the list. We have linked some of these messages directly to 
the name of the woman in question. This is part of a specific woman's
history 
and  shows why many women never came
out. See "We get letters" next to her name. 
<p>
** 
Sorry, but we cannot provide research services that
take more than a few minutes, without charging a fee.
This is because we have one staff person and no dependable
funding. The fees help us to maintain the project and provide
services. Usually (not always) the fee is $25/hr with a one hour minimum.
<p>

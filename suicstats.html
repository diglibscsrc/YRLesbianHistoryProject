This is from an annotated bib I did for a class a few summers ago, on
multicultural literature (I talked the prof into not ignoring queer
culture). Hope it helps.

According to this study, gay and lesbian youth are two to three times more
likely to commit suicide than other youths, and 30 percent of all
completed youth suicides are related to the issue of sexual identity.

This study tried to sift through the various stress factors involved in
suicide.  "According to the results of this study, the single largest
predictor of mental health was self-acceptance."  "A general sense of
personal worth, coupled with a positive view of their sexual orientation,
appears to be critical for the youths' mental health."  "[F]amily support
moderated the effects of victimization on mental health, but only for
relatively low levels of victimization."

This study of minority, working class, and homosexual youths found that of
those who had experienced physical assault, almost 1/2 of these cases
reported that the assault was gay-related.  Furthermore, of those who had
experienced assault, 41% of the girls and 34% of the boys reporting had
tried to kill themselves.  This study mostly points to further research
which should be undertaken in this area.

it at least once.

What this study looked at was suicidal and non-suicidal gay youths.  It
found that three factors, in particular, could be seen as contributing to
greater suicidal tendencies: 1) a father's alcoholism; 2) no religion; 3)
racial/ethnic minority status.

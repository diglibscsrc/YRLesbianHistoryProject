     My name is Leona McElvene.  I live in Detroit, Michigan and I am a
friend of Ruth Ellis.  This is just a note to thank you for creating and
supporting a web page for Ruth Ellis.  I was so excited and happy to see
it.  Sarah Uhle of Lansing, Michigan gave me the web address and said
that you would love to hear from people who have met Ruth Ellis.
<p>
     I first talked with Ruthie about 11 years ago.  I was in line with
other women waiting to dance with Ruth at a lesbian bar called the
"Railroad Crossing".  It seemed that Ruth did not tire of dancing.  She
danced with partner after partner.  It blew my mind to learn that Ruth
was in her eighties at that time.  I was also told by one of Ruth's
escorts, a white female German doctor named Morilla, that very few black
women seemed willing to escort Ruth to places in the lesbian community.
Morilla's comment both surprised and embarrassed me.  I decided that I
would become one of the black women willing to escort Ruth to places in
the lesbian community.  Ruth gave me her home phone number and told me
that she loves to go places.
<p>
     Over the years, Ruth and I have gone many places together.  These
places include: women's coffeehouses, dinners, parties, bars, lectures,
conferences, church, women's music festivals, grocery stores, plays,
movies, the symphony orchestra (she loves classical music), museums, and
more.  Over the years, Ruth has accompanied me through my romantic
break-ups, job layoffs, job promotions, mothering my daughter, and more
by being a source of inspiration and encouragement as I went through my
changes.
<p>
     Today, ... [we] talk on the phone about 2 or 3 times a week.
...
I look forward to talking with my Ruthie on a regular basis and she
is looking forward to her 100th birthday in July 1999.  We are both hoping
that she makes it to her 100th birthday and some.
<p>
Thank you again,
Leona

Hello Ms. Ellis. I feel very fortunate to have found your site again.
I happened upon it when my mother first got this Webtv in June, but
could not find it again. I had forgotten to write down your name. All I
could remember was that you had run your own printing business and that
you were a Black Lesbian.
<p>
I am so impressed that there is actually a Black woman in the Life as
old as you. Hats off and hail to you. I, myself, am 49 this past
September. I have been in the life for over 30 years and am proud to be
gay. I have
never been in the closet because when I realized that I had feelings for
women, at the age of 18 I just went for the gusto (lol).
<p>
I am a second year Carpenter's apprentice in the union. Whenever I get
on a job site and the others learn of my age, they look to see if I can
handle the work. I can and I do. I have only been on a bridge job and
this past year, on an airport parking garage project (we built it from
the ground up 5 levels).
<p>
Anyway, enough about me. I hope you don't mind if I tell your story and
show the photos of you at our (SABIL, Sisters and Brothers In the Life)
Black History meeting. There is also a women's group who will be
honoring Black History (Herstory) Month and will be putting paintings
and photos in the window of their building.
<p>
A couple of teenagers working on the project at the women's building
asked me for some input about Black Lesbians, and here you are. How
appropriate, I think, you being older and accomplished, and they being
so young.
I've given them some information on and pictures about Ma Rainey.
I am also going to give them information about Tiffany St. Cloud, the
youth activist that was inducted into the city of Chicago Commission on
Human Relations Gay &amp; Lesbian Hall of Fame.
<p>
...Take care and keep on trucking.
<p>
Gladys M. Brown

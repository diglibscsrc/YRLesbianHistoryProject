LESBIAN STUDIES IN THE SOUTHWEST
<p>
     In the last ten years we have witnessed the development of
Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies as a field of scholarly inquiry. 
This development has been characterized in part by the study of
sexuality and desire as socially constructed categories and of
the experiences and struggles of gay men and lesbians in the
past and today.  The growth and health of this new field,
however, is rooted in and supported by the emergence of a
vibrant and increasingly visible lesbian/gay/bisexual social
movement. In fact, the 1980s and 1990s have recreated many of
the same social, political and academic conditions which led to
the establish-ment of the first interdiscplinary studies
programs addressing gender, race and ethnicity in the early
1970s.  While the wealth of new scholarship is exciting, as in
other realms of academic inquiry, the primary focus has been on
communities, cultures, and issues associated with the north-
eastern US.  Consequently, it is particularly important to take
note of the development of scholarship, curriculum, and
organizations in the Southwest.
<p>
     Within the academy lesbian/gay/bisexual students, teachers
and scholars have structured their efforts to develop curriculum
and gain support for their work within the broader frame-work of
their universities' commitments to "diversity" in education and
to the creation of supportive climates for such diversity.  At
the University of Arizona such efforts have been centralized
through the creation of the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies
Committee.  Formed in 1993, this committee, composed of
students, staff, and faculty has had some success in securing
institutional support for a Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies
curriculum.  Graduate students in the English  Department,  for 
example,  created  and taught a two-part undergraduate course in
Lesbian/ Gay Literature in 1991; the first of its kind at UA. 
Welcomed by students, this course is part of the regular
offerings of the English Department which has pledged its
support for the course's contin-uation.  In addition, Janet
Jakobsen (Women's Studies) regularly offers a course serving
both undergraduate and graduate students, titled
"Lesbian/Bisexual Women's Theories/Activisms/ Lives."  Bev
Seckinger (Media Arts) and Janice Dewey (Humanities) are
currently developing Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies courses with
the support of their departments.  
<p>
     The University of Arizona is not the only Arizona
university with a Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies curriculum.  ASU
Professor Robert Foster (Spanish/Portuguese) offers a
Lesbian/Gay Sexualities seminar focusing on Latin America and
Annis Hopkins (Women's Studies) has taught her "Lesbian
Cultures" course since 1987.  Lesbian/ Gay/Bisexual faculty and
staff at ASU also recently held their first meeting to discuss
their role within the university in relation to campus and
curricular diversity. 
<p>
     As in other areas nationwide, southwestern lesbian
scholars, students, and activists are struggling to construct
spaces for themselves and their work within both the academy and
broader community in a time of backlash and retrench-ment.  This
backlash, and reaction to it, has spurred, on some campuses,
administrative recog-nition of the need to include
Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies curriculum within the broader
framework of "diversity."  Additionally, lesbian/gay/bisexual
faculty, staff, and students are responding by developing
organizations and committees intended to create a more positive
university environment to facilitate curriculum development and
support student interest in Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual studies.  The
struggle over Amendment Two in Colorado, for example, provided
the impetus for the hiring of the first Lesbian Studies scholar
within the Colorado System, Nan Boyd (UC-Boulder/ Women's
Studies).  Additionally, the administration at UC-Boulder
created a faculty committee to address the establishment of a
Lesbian/Gay Studies Program and undergraduate major.  These
efforts in Colorado are being capped by a two day "Queer
Studies" Conference, April 9-10, being held on the Boulder
campus and open to faculty, students, and staff currently with
the Colorado System.  
<p>
     Perhaps nothing represents the connection between community
and academy as much as the explosion of scholarship within the
field of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Studies, including works which
focus on the construction of lesbian/gay communities and
cultures and those which offer theoretical models for
understanding this process and struggle.  Work by southwestern
scholars both reflects and reinforces this trend.  Nan Boyd (UC-
Boulder/Women's Studies) is completing her dissertation, an oral
history study of San Francisco lesbian and gay communities.  In
addition, Yolanda Retter's (UNM/American Studies) disserta-tion,
"A Preliminary History of Feminist/Lesbian Communities of Los
Angeles, 1970-1990," and Yolanda Leyva's (UA/History) work on
the Tucson lesbian community should provide important
information on the formation of southwestern lesbian culture. 
At the same time, Emma Perez (UTEP/History) continues her path
breaking theoretical work on Chicana lesbians with her latest
article, "Irigaray's Female Symbolic in the Making of Chicana
Lesbians Sitios y Linguas (Sites and Discourses)," appearing in
the forthcoming anthology The Lesbian Postmodern (ed. Linda
Dean, Columbia University Press).
<p>
     This scholarship is joined by other "bridges" between
community and academy.  Yolanda Leyva, for example, has followed
the direction of 
community-based archives, such as the Lesbian Herstory Archives
(New York City), by establishing the first Lesbiana Latina
Archives. (See the Research Wanted section for more
information.)  There also several local conferences springing
from the cooperation between academic and broader communties. 
The University of Utah has joined with the American Civil
Liberties Union to sponsor a conference entitled, "Turning the
Century: Communication, Coalition and Change in an Environment
Increasingly Hostile to Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals," to be
held May 13-15, 1994.  Last, the Lesbianas Latinas de Tucson is
sponsoring a regional conference for/on southwestern Latina
Lesbians to be held this fall. (See the Future Conferences
section for more information on these events.)

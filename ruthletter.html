<h3> LETTER TO FRIENDS OF RUTH/RUTH'S SCHEDULE OF APPEARANCES </h3>
<p>
August 20, 1999
<p>
Dear friends of Ruth Ellis,             
<p>
       Thank you for sending email to Ruth.  Currently she does not have
her
own computer, so we print out her emails and she reads them the old
fashioned
way.  
<p>She has received hundreds in the last few months, and feels pretty
overwhelmed by all the attention she is getting.  But she reads every one,
and enjoys telling people that she gets email.
   <p>     For those of you who have been forwarding fun things to her, we
will
need to ask you to remove her from your "bulk mail" list.  It is a problem
to
get copies of mass mailings that are not to her individually.   Her eyes
are
not good, and we don't want to strain them with extra reading.  We
appreciate
your attention to taking care of this.
      <p> Of course she is not able to respond to all this mail she gets,
but
she does want to thank people for thinking of her.  She's been very busy
this
year!  
<p>
To order her film, call 1-800-343-5540 or send $30 + $5 s/h to Our Film
Works, PO Box 267848, Chicago, IL 60626, or go to www.sistersinthelife.com
<p>
You can mail cards or donations for Ruth's "Travel" Fund to Ruth Ellis,
    PO Box 76, Okemos, MI 48805-0076.  (Ruth lives on the minimal SS
income,
and is very appreciative of any and all donations.  Please make checks
payable to Ruth Ellis.)
<p>
Ruth thanks you again for your messages.
<p>
             Sincerely, Sarah Uhle for Ruth
             (A friend, and her "secretary")
<p>

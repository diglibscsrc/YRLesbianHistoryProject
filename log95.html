<h2>Lesbian Log - 1995 </h2>
<p> 
Information was gathered from various sources on the Internet (mostly
e-mail
lists I subscribe to) that relates to current
issues in lesbian life. Information was generally copied verbatim and
includes typos, etc.

<b>UNITED STATES</b>: Oct. 31 -- U.S. Army Captain Michael McManus revealed
that General Colin Powell
knew he was gay while McManus was serving as his personal bodyguard, and
that it made no difference to the
general. While stationed in Frankfurt, Germany in 1986, then Sergeant
McManus served as Powell's
bodyguard and interpreter, and it was during that time that Sgt. McManus
"came out" to him, confiding to him
that he was gay. According to McManus, Gen. Powell, who was at that time
the commander of the U.S. Army
Fifth Corps, replied, "What do you want me to do about it? As long as you
are doing your job well, that does
not matter to me.And you are doing an excellent job." 
Capt. McManus came out of the closet as a gay man publicly on Saturday May
29, 1993 at a Memorial
Weekend Requiem in San Francisco honoring the Unknown Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual
Soldiers. The event was
sponsored by the San Francisco Area chapter of the GLAAD and endorsed by
many organizations, including
the Alexander Hamilton Post of the American Legion. McManus chose the San
Francisco requiem event as the
time to come out publicly because he "can no longer be a part of an
organization that promotes and supports
such blatant discrimination. It is time for people to realize that sexual
orientation is a fundamental part of a
person's identity, just as being Asian or African-American." Capt. McManus
(in 1993) plans on being vocal
about the military's gay and lesbian ban. He currently serves in the U.S.
Army Reserves and holds a top secret
security clearance." 
This article appeared in the Summer 1993. The publication is: "For
Veterans Only." The newsletter was
published by The Campaign For Military Service. The newsletter says: "The
news in this newsletter is as
accurate as possible." The article was written by Miriam Ben-Shalom and
others. Randolph Webb

<b>UNITED STATES/COLORADO</b>: Oct. 16 -- I just wanted to share some news I got
last night at chorus
rehearsal. During our announcements Celeste stood up and announced that
the judge had signed the adoption
papers and her partner, Judy, is now a legal parent of Celeste's 4 year
old daughter. YES!!! And she mentioned
that another couple in chorus is in the process of doing the same for
their son. Both sets of parents live in
Boulder County where the legal climate has been supportive of lesbian and
gay civil rights for some years.

<b>UNITED STATES/MAINE</b>: Nov. 8 -- Voters in Maine today rejected a
discriminatory ballot measure that
sought to forever deny basic rights to gay and lesbian Mainers. Question
1, the only anti-gay measure on a state
ballot this year, was the first such initiative to appear on a state
ballot east of the Rocky Mountains. Last year,
voters in Idaho and Oregon rejected anti-gay measures. 
"Common sense and decency triumphed over extremism. Today's vote here in
Maine is in keeping with the
national trend. Americans are rejecting extremism," said Elizabeth Birch,
executive director of the Human
Rights Campaign, the largest national lesbian and gay political
organization. "But we must put this campaign in
perspective. While this was a wonderful victory, gay and lesbian citizens
of Maine have not moved one step
closer to having basic equal rights. Gay and lesbian people can still be
fired from their jobs, even in Maine,
merely for being gay." Birch noted that Maine is one of the 41 states that
does not protect its citizens from
discrimination based on sexualorientation, and that federal law also
offers no such protection. 
The Human Rights Campaign sent eight staff members to Maine and provided
major technical and financial
assistance to Maine Won't Discriminate, the local coalition of religious,
business, and community organizations
that worked to defeat Question 1. The Human Rights Campaign is also the
largest single financial contributor to
the legal challenge against Colorado's Amendment 2, which is now before
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
National extreme right groups actively pushed for a "yes" vote on Question
1. Bob Knight of the Family
Research Council toured the state calling on voters to approve the
measure, as did Beverly LaHaye of
Concerned Women for America. Focus on the Family aired radio
advertisements in favor of the initiative.
Unlike earlier anti-gay measures, the language of Question 1 avoided
mentioning lesbian and gay people. The
question asked voters to limit "protected classifications" in current and
future state and local laws to ten specific
categories -- not including sexual orientation. 
The measure would have repealed two local non-discrimination laws that
include gay people, and would have
prohibited communities from passing such laws in the future. No federal or
Maine state law protects people
from being fired, refused work, or otherwise discriminated against merely
for being lesbian or gay. Question 1
was written by Bruce Fein, a right-wing lawyer based in Virginia, to
circumvent court decisions saying that
gays should not be singled out for discrimination... 
While the official vote tally will not be available until early Wednesday,
November 8th, morning, At 11:28
p.m. EST, with 71 percent of the votes in and counted, the Portland NBC
affiliate declared Question 1 defeated
at 52-48. Earlier exit polls predicted the victory.

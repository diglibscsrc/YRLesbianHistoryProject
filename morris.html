<h2> IN MEMORIAM: MORRIS KIGHT </h2>
<p>
January 19, 2003, LOS ANGELES, CA 
<br/>
Friends of Morris Kight
<p>
- Having declared three decades ago "I'm
sure we are going to get our freedom, I see it everywhere," gay rights
pioneer Morris Kight died peacefully in his sleep this morning, ending a
prolific career that achieved many of the civil rights he sought.
Kight was 83.
<p>
"Morris Kight can never be replaced, but will and must be remembered," 
said
fellow activist, longtime friend and contemporary Ivy Bottini.  "Our 
country
and our nation has lost a voice of sanity and hospitality, not just for 
the
lesbian and gay community, but for disenfranchised people everywhere."
<p>
"Today marks the end of an era," said Michael Weinstein, who heads the 
U.S.
largest AIDS organization and whom Kight befriended in 1973.  "Morris not
only inspired events and organizations, he inspired activists through his
loving nature.  He genuinely loved people, and that permeated everything 
he did."
<p>
The long-time Los Angeles resident was born November 19, 1919, in Comanche
County Texas.  Kight graduated from Texas Christian University.  He often
cited Eleanor Roosevelt as an influence on his values and his activism.  
He
came to prominence with the Dow Action Committee, protesting weapons
manufacturing during the Vietnam War.  In 1969, he and a handful launched
the Gay Liberation Front - one of the first such efforts.  In 1971, he
co-founded the Los Angeles Gay &amp; Lesbian Community Services Center, the
first and largest such center in the world.
<p>
Rarely satisfied with all he had achieved, Kight also created some of the
movement's most visible efforts, including:
<p>
· Los Angeles' gay pride march - the Christopher Street West Parade - 
which
he co-created in 1970 and which receives international media attention
annually;
<br/>
· The Morris Kight Collection, which archives thousands of artifacts
chronicling the emergence of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender civil
rights;
<br/>
· Stonewall Democratic Club, whose endorsement is highly prized in
California politics.
<p>
Last year, after serving twenty years on the Los Angeles County Human
Relations Commission, Morris retired from public service but continued to
speak out on behalf of people in need.  Most recently he spent his 
birthday
as a witness before the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors testifying
for better AIDS services.
<p>
Though most strongly identified with the movement for gay, lesbian, 
bisexual
and transgender rights, Kight consistently allied his energies with many
other progressive causes.  He described himself as a laborite, a civil
rights advocate, a civil libertarian, and an advocate for all oppressed
people.
<p>
Kight's tireless activism and political savvy made him a rare bridge 
between
the gay grassroots and elected officials at local, state, and federal
levels.  Though he never ran for office himself, his political insight was
frequently sought by those in power and those who aspire to public 
service.
<p>
Kight foresaw the advances his work would lead to in a 1971 interview with
the Advocate magazine:  "Frankly, I'm sure we are going to get our 
freedom.
I see it everywhere:  In the marketplace, in the stores, in the homes, in
dealing with families, in the kind of attention we get from radio,
television and the newspapers.  Still, I realize we're not home yet.  We
have a long way to go.  There are 1,750 arrests in L.A. each month.  I 
weep
for each of them.  Everyone who's denied a job, I weep for.  Everyone who 
is
driven from their homes by a misunderstanding family, I have to offer my
love to."
<p>
Kight spent his final days at Carl Bean House in Los Angeles, a guest of 
the
AIDS Healthcare Foundation, one of the many agencies he nurtured and
supported.
<p>
A celebration of his life has been scheduled for Saturday, February 1, at 
1 p.m., in the Metropolitan Community Church, 8714 Santa Monica Boulevard 
in West Hollywood 90069.
<p>
Friends are invited to stop and leave flowers at West Hollywood's Matthew
Shepard Memorial Triangle - corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Crescent
Heights.  A magnolia tree with a plaque honoring Kight has been planted at
the triangle.
<p>
ONE Institute and Archives, will house and maintain the Morris Kight
Art Collection, at 909 W. Adams Blvd, Los Angeles CA 90007. Donations in 
Kight's memory are being accepted by this non-profit to maintain the 
collection.

Morris Kight, 83; Gay Rights Pioneer in the Southland
<br/>
By Nancy Wride, Times Staff Writer
<p>
Morris Kight, a pioneering leader in Southern
California's gay rights movement, died Sunday morning.
He was 83.
Kight, who served for more than 20 years on the Los
Angeles Human Rights Commission as its most senior
member until his retirement last year, died in his
sleep at a hospice in Los Angeles.
<p>
He was hospitalized in early December in declining
health with a variety of ailments, including liver
cancer, heart problems and eventually pneumonia. His
health was further compromised by a series of strokes
suffered late in life.
<p>
The co-founder of the Gay and Lesbian Community Service
Center of L.A. (now called the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian
Center), Kight also was a key organizer of the West
Coast's first gay pride parade and celebration in 1970,
which effectively galvanized the modern gay rights
movement in Los Angeles. The parade has drawn nearly
500,000 people in recent years.
<p>
"Morris invented a great deal of what we think of as
the gay community in Southern California," said Miki
Jackson, a gay and lesbian-rights activist who also is
a consultant for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. "He
had tremendous vision and imagination and great drive
to make his visions a reality."
<p>
With his wide straw hat and portly stoop, Kight cut a
striking figure at gay rights parades, civic protests
and vigils honoring hate crime victims -- events that
he led or actively supported over the decades.
<p>
One of the best known was a weeks-long 1970
demonstration outside Barney's Beanery, the well-known
West Hollywood bar, which had a bar sign reading
"Faggots Stay Out!"
<p>
After three weeks of protests, employees surrendered
the offending sign. Despite promises, a new sign
appeared, and was removed in 1985. As a constant
reminder of the need for vigilance, a framed copy of
the sign hung over Kight's sofa in the modest West
Hollywood apartment he shared with his beloved cats.
<p>
Years later, Kight would tell a USC film student
profiling him that his favorite picket sign outside
Barney's Beanery was "Beans for Queens."
<p>
Widely viewed by human rights activists as a key figure
in the West Coast fight to end discrimination against
homosexuals, Kight was less well known to gays
unconnected with politics.
<p>
"Morris comes from an era where to be openly gay, you
were putting your physical safety on the line," Los
Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told The
Times some years ago.
<p>
"People today forget that.... In those days, you were
risking your well-being. You were risking harassment,
you were risking arrest, you were risking getting
beaten up by hate-mongers. And the law enforcement
community didn't think twice about hassling gays."
"He was fearless," Yaroslavsky said.
<p>
The AIDS epidemic claimed many Kight peers who
otherwise might have passed on the history of the
movement to younger generations, several activists
noted.
<p>
"AIDS was a holocaust in our community," said Nancy
Cohen, a friend of Kight and a former member of the
West Hollywood Lesbian and Gay Advisory Board, "and
when I see our community, so many people of my
generation don't know who Morris is. If we didn't have
Morris and a handful of others like him, we wouldn't be
where we are today. He has paved the way for people to
feel comfortable in their own skin."
<p>
Kight's human rights activism predated his work in what
was a fledgling gay rights movement, and later in life
he proudly displayed photographs of himself with civil
rights leaders such as farm labor organizer Cesar
Chavez.
<p>
When homosexual patrons of the Stonewall Inn on
Christopher Street in New York City refused police
orders to leave in 1969, the modern gay rights movement
was effectively launched.
<p>
At the time, Kight was best known for leading a
campaign against Dow Chemical and the napalm it
manufactured for use during the Vietnam War.
<p>
A friend involved in the New York uprising challenged
Kight, then 50, to make a similar stand on the West
Coast, and Kight and a few others started what became
the annual gay pride parade and festival. It might be
hard to imagine that leading such a parade back then
could endanger their lives, but death threats were
lodged. The band of gay rights protesters marched
through the streets anyway.
<p>
"The first entry was a lesbian on horseback," Kight
told a Times reporter not long ago. "Where they got
that horse I have no idea -- then a man with a big
'Homosexuals for Reagan' banner."
<p>
The parade is the largest west of the Mississippi
River, and the third largest in the nation.

Both events have been organized every year by
Christopher Street West, a nonprofit organization Kight
helped launch.
<p>
He also founded the Stonewall Democratic Club, a gay
and lesbian political party, in October 1975.
<p>
"In the gay and lesbian community," former West
Hollywood Mayor John Heilman once observed, only half
joking, "Morris has started so many organizations, we
sometimes joke that he probably invented sex,
chocolate, disco music and almost everything else."
<p>
Kight was born in Texas, but his activism evolved and
matured elsewhere.
<p>
For the last several decades, he made Los Angeles and
later, Hollywood, his home. Always theatrical, Kight
found his way to the spotlight quickly.
<p>
"Though he'd only become an activist two years earlier,
by 1971 Morris Kight was omnipresent in Los Angeles'
Gay Liberation Front," reported "Long Road to Freedom:
The Advocate History of the Gay and Lesbian Movement,"
a 1994 chronicle published by the Advocate, the
nation's largest gay newspaper.
<p>
"A political wheeler-dealer par excellence ... Kight
had a genius for publicity," the Advocate reported.
"Although some denounced him as a 'media freak,' he
became an oft-quoted and much-photographed spokesman
for gay liberation."
<p>
He lived frugally, supporting himself from the early
1950s on with proceeds of twice-yearly yard sales at
which he sold restored antiques and collectibles.
<p>
He claimed to be the first in the Los Angeles area to
throw a yard sale. But with his slightly affected
speaking style, he noted: "I sold brass, silver, china,
silverware; I was great at weavings. I accumulated many
dealers, and customers like Liberace, a gay pianist who
was a great collector. I'd keep track of what they
liked and when I got something I would call them up.
And enough money came in from that to pay the lights,
rent and gas and car travel. I didn't earn enough out
of it to pay income taxes, so that was never an issue."
<p>
Out of that eccentric income came the 3,000-piece
Morris Kight Collection, a trove of fine art, art
produced by gays and lesbians and collectibles such as
political posters that chronicle the evolution of the
homosexual rights movement. He recently arranged for
the collection to be donated to the ONE Institute at
USC.
<p>
What once was a rhythmic cadence in speaking was lost
after Kight suffered a series of five strokes in nine
years, which ultimately left him relying on a walker.
But physical challenges never slowed Kight for long.
<p>
"I've known Morris as long as I've been on the board of
the organization, about five years," Sharon Donning, a
leader of Christopher Street West, said in
1999.
<p>
"But I've known about him my whole life. I admire
Morris because he's the one who got it all started in
L.A. ... And we wouldn't be here without him,
basically."
<p>
Kight is survived by his life partner of 25 years, Roy
Zucheran; two daughters, Carol Kight of Claremont and
Angela Bonin of Texas; two grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.
<p>
A memorial service is scheduled at 1 p.m. Feb. 1 at
Metropolitan Community Church, 8714 Santa Monica Blvd.,
West Hollywood.

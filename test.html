<h2> Objectives of The Lesbian History Project: </h2>
<p> 
to promote lesbian history and visibility. <br/>
<p>
to create an online record of lesbian history that contains:
<br/>
information on lesbian accomplishments and contributions. <br/>
information on work done and/or in progress;<br/>
other related information.<br/>
<p>
to assist lesbian archives and collections in putting lists of their 
holdings up on the web.<br/>
<p>
to assist projects that record, transcribe and
preserve oral histories of lesbians, especially lesbians of color (in the
u.s. and elsewhere)
<p>
to help researchers locate primary witnesses and documents.
<p>
to promote ongoing dialogue between academic lgbt scholars and lgbt
community scholars and between academics and the lgbt communities in
general. <br/>
<p>
to articulate and promote the importance of native research to lesbian
(and gay/bi/tg) history. <br/>
<p>
to encourage organizations to raise funds and/or set aside funds to 
support work in lesbian (and gay/bi/tg) history. <br/>
<p>
to encourage individuals and groups to donate original papers, documents 
and memorabilia to archives that preserve and promote lesbian history and
visibility. <br/>
<p>
to use the web site as an educational and training tool for women of all 
ages and backgrounds. <br/>
<p>
to host an annual meeting for purposes of "support and report" for those
doing work in lgbt history, preservation, cataloging,
indexing, research and www dissemination. <br/>
<p>

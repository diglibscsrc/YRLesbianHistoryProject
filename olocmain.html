<h3>This was the site of the original temporary OLOC web site.</h3>
<p>
When OLOC created their permanent site, they asked that this site be taken
down.
<p>
I explained that since links take a long time to be taken down, 
that it would be best to state that the site was an old one
and provide a LINK to the current official site.
<br>
This was done for the Ohio 
Lesbian Archives and seems to work.
<br>
OLOC in their infinite terquedad born of politics, declined the offer.
<br>
So this link sits in cyberspace with no forwarding link.
Sorry.
<p>
P.S. There is also another organization with similar initials:
<br>
Old Lesbians of Color

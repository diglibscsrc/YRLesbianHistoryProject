<dd>Carole Leita's excellent index to the 'Net is <em>not </em>only for librarians. Ms. Leita collected and organized sites for several years as a librarian at the Berkeley Public Library. Her site has become so popular and extensive that it has migrated to a machine at U.C. Berkeley. She covers many facets of the Web, but particularly pertinent are her categories dealing with women and with gays and lesbians. <font size="-1">

<b>UNITED STATES (Oregon)</b> -
 A state appeals court ruled that three lesbian  workers at
Oregon Health Sciences University were entitled to health benefits for
their
partners. The ruling is being described as a "milestone" that may give
more
rights to gay employees of Oregon's public colleges and other state
agencies (The Chronicle of Higher Education).

<b>ISRAEL</b> - Michal Eden, the first open lesbian to run  for the Tel
Aviv's municipal Council was elected yesterday. Eden, from Meretz party
was elected in
the primaries to the second place in her party, mostly thanks to the gay
and lesbian community in Tel Aviv, the largest city in Israel. Yesterday,
in the
municipal elections, Eden's party won 4 seats in the municipality. Eden
is the first openly gay person to run for  a political position in Israel.
We are all very proud of her!!! <br/><br/>CLAF

<b>UNITED STATES</b> -Wisconsin - 
Election of the first openly gay woman to Congress didn't turn on sexual
issues, but it
means a great deal to gay rights activists nonetheless.
Tammy Baldwin, a Democratic state representative from Wisconsin, defeated
Republican Josephine Musser, the former state insurance commissioner.
Baldwin is also the first woman elected to Congress from Wisconsin.
Two other openly lesbian Democrats sought House seats. Grethe Cammermeyer,
a former Army colonel, was
defeated by GOP Rep. Jack Metcalf in Washington state and Christine Kehoe
was trailing Republican Rep.

<b>UNITED STATES (WASHINGTON, D.C.)</b> - The Second Circuit Court of Appeals
today upheld the
Administration's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue" policy in Able v.
USA. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals joins three other appellate
courts in the
Fourth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits that have upheld the current policy on
gays
in the military.Today's decision comes on the heels of a new survey
released on September 4,
1998 indicating a significant drop in "strong opposition" to gay men and
lesbians in the military by soldiers.  The survey, conducted by Professor
Charles Moskos of Northwestern University, the author of "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell, Don't Pursue," and Laura Miller of UCLA, found that the number of
Army
men strongly opposed to the presence of gay men and lesbians in the
military
has dropped from 67% in 1992 to 36% in 1998. Army women's opposition has
also
dropped significantly from 31% in 1992 to 16% in 1998, according to the
recent
study.  (Press Release SLDN1@aol.com).

<b>NEW ZEALAND - (August)</b>
A Hamilton District Court judge yesterday granted a lesbian mother the
right to child support from her former lesbian partner. The women were
in a relationship for 14 years and considered themselves married, sharing
a surname, a Three News report said last night. In the period of their
marriage the couple decided to have children and one gave birth to three
children through artificial insemination. 
Judge Brown upheld the birth mother's
application for her former partner to be considered a legal stepparent of
their children and therefore eligible to pay child maintenance. Victoria
University women's studies senior lecturer Alison Laurie said yesterday
that such a ruling signaled a change in official attitudes to same-sex
relationships.

<b>CALIFORNIA</b> - Los Angeles Times, May 16:<br/>
Girl beaten for being lesbian    
<br/><br/>
 A 17-year-old student at James Monroe High School was beaten by three
other girls at the school, allegedly
because her attackers believed she was a lesbian, authorities said Friday. 
The young woman was kicked and punched in a restroom at the high school.
While beating her, the attackers made
disparaging comments about her sexual orientation, said Sgt. Bruce
Heschong of the Los Angeles Police
Department. Heschong said police are investigating the May 6 attack as a
hate crime. 
<br/><br/>
The victim complained of aches and pain after the beating, and was taken
to the doctor by her mother, Heschong
said. Joan Elam, the school principal, said she believes the girl's attackers
were students at the school. School officials
and school police were continuing to investigate, and will turn over any
information to Los Angeles police, Elam
said. According to school police, the victim was in a restroom stall when she
heard three young women talking just
outside. She told officers she believed they were talking about her. 
When she left the stall, one of the others called her a "dyke" and hit her
in the back, she said. A fistfight ensued,
pitting three against one. 
<br/><br/>
The victim, a junior, is a member of Project 10, a peer support group
consisting mainly of gay and lesbian
students, said teacher Debbie Fordham, the coordinator of the group. 
"She's very sociable . . . a well-liked kid," Fordham said. 
Fordham said the young woman may require knee surgery as a result of a
kick to the leg during the attack. 
"She's handling it as well as can be expected," she said. "She's concerned
not only for herself but for the other
kids on campus." <br/><br/>
Elam said the young woman has returned to school and appeared to be in
good spirits. 
Both Elam and Fordham said the attack, if it was indeed motivated by the
victim's sexual orientation, was an
isolated incident at the school. 
To guard against further violence, school officials have invited a gay
rights group to meet with students next
month. <br/><br/>
"We're going to let them talk about what it is about gays and lesbians
that bothers them so much," said Judy
Chiasson, of Gays and Lesbians Initiating Dialogues for Equality. "Then
we'll try to address that. It's not a
lecture. There are many people who feel they've never had a conversation
with a gay or lesbian person."

<b> UNITED STATES </b> - (April)  (From Datalounge). <br/><br/> 
The Congressional Quarterly reports
four lesbian candidates, all Democrats, are waging
competitive
campaigns for seats in the House of
Representatives this                         year.
The Quarterly notes an openly gay woman has never
been
 elected to Congress. In fact, The Quarterly
notes, while
                         Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), Rep. Jim Kolbe
(R-Ariz.),
                         former Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), and former
Rep.
                         Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) are all openly gay, all
four were
                         in office before they announced or confirmed
their sexual
                         orientation.
<br/><br/> 
                         "We do have a good chance now to make some
history,"
                         said Mindy Daniels, executive director of the
National
                         Lesbian Political Action Committee. She noted two
of the
                         four gay Congressional candidates this year are
from
                         states that have had gay members in their
delegations
                         before, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, and three of
the four
                         have been elected to state or local office.
 <br/><br/> 
                         Each of the candidates faces a unique set of
challenges.
                         Retired Army Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer is
probably
                         the best known of the four in her fight to unseat
incumbent
                         Rep. Jack Metcalf. 
But The Quarterly notes that
her
                         notoriety may be more of a handicap in her
conservative
                         district than a help. She says she is struggling
to overcome
                         the "lesbian" label affixed in so many voters'
minds.
                         "Labels have a way of stirring up every
individual's
                         stereotypes," she said.
 <br/><br/> 
                         Rep. Barney Frank says that for any minority
candidate,
                         getting past the label is crucial. The most
difficult thing, he
                         says, is convincing voters that you will not
                         disproportionately focus on that minority's
issues. "The
                         danger is they [the candidates] spend all their
time talking
                         to gay groups," he said.
 <br/><br/> 
                         State Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who became the first
gay
                         member of the Wisconsin Legislature in 1993, is
running
                         for the open seat vacated by Republican Rep.
Scott L.
                         Klug. Observers say Baldwin, who is widely
respected for
                         her tenacity and eloquence in the state, has one
of the best
                         shots at winning.
                         "While there will always be a handful of people
who might
                         not vote for a woman or who might not vote for
someone
                         because they are gay or lesbian," she told The
Quarterly,
                         "the vast majority will make their decision based
on
                         competence and issues."
 <br/><br/> 
                         Another candidate with excellent odds is San
Diego City
                         Councilwoman Christine Kehoe, the likely
Democratic
                         nominee against GOP Rep. Brian P. Bilbray of
California.
                         Kehoe won 79 percent of the vote in her last
council run.
                         "I run as who I am," said Kehoe, who has already
outraised
Bilbray by $125,000 in the quarter ending March
31. But "[being gay] is not what I'm running on.
Education,[reproductive] choice, the environment, handgun
control;
all these issues are the big issues for the
voters of the 49th
Congressional District."
<p>
Former state Rep. Susan Tracy, running for the
open seat
of retiring Democratic Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II
in
Massachusetts, says she hopes the public is ready
to make
history.
"This is a district that paved the way for the
first Catholic to
become president," she said, referring to John F.
Kennedy,
who represented the Boston district from 1947 to
1953.
"And maybe this is the district that could pave
the way for
the first person who happens to be gay to be
elected to
Congress."

<b>ITALY </b>- Lesbian Week (3rd annual)
<br/><br/>
Lesbian weeks events are the expression of a project which keeps
together many lesbians who are working around a political agreement
and a belief that out of this context we can get the opportunity
to set an agenda for a political action common to us all.
The first lesbian week (1991), called "A Place for Us", was promoted
mostly by lesbian separatist organizations; the second (1996), called
"Lesbian Community. Freedom of Movement", was characterized by the
political gathering of separatist and non-separatist groups and it
highlighted the urgency of constituting a more articulated lesbian
movement, differentiated in its structure and able to deliver clear
statements about social and world occurences.
<br/><br/>
The difficulty to relate different political practices has recently
caused harsh internal conflicts, but we are still working intensly in
the belief that the Lesbian Forum (the committee promoting this third
national gathering) will show how joining forces can be effective
only when we accept to take the risk of a reciprocal "contamination"
and a new questioning of our political stances, so far considered
quite unbreachable, even at the cost of lacerating changes.
Today the bet we want to bring forth again is the very articulation
of those differences which brought us together some years ago: we are
determined to resist the temptation to keep on building political
boundaries within which we have rooted and set ourselves in the past.
We will attempt to make an improvement of our political strategies,
and to achieve a deeper understanding of the signification that
lesbian culture and politics have assumed in the world.
We believe the raw material of our debates should not just be used to
trace the boundaries of our differences, but it should become the
object of a consideration which will involve an ever growing number
of lesbians.
<br/><br/>
With the third lesbian week we intend to develop a method of analysis
of the meanings and the effectiveness of our different practices,
extended to lesbians from european and extra-european countries as
well, with the aim of building and maintaining a space for a
political interaction, also with an open outlook onto the Millenium
World Pride to be held in Rome, to which the Forum should take part
thorugh its participation to an international lesbian committee,
and to create a context where lesbian sociality and culture can be
expressed with forms like perfomances, concerts, shows, movies,
social events etc etc.
<br/><br/>
The organization of an active international lesbian mobilization
is a necessity which we have to be able to build in order to give a
less territorial dimension to the italian lesbian movement and a
greater visibility within larger political contexts.<br/><br/>

<b>NAMIBIA (April 3):</b>
Lesbian wins permanent residence case -
<br/>
The High Court of Namibia today ordered the Ministry of Home Affairs to
grant permanent residence to Liz Frank, a German national who has lived
and
worked in Namibia for eight years. Frank decided to take her case to the
High Court after two applications for permanent residence were rejected
by
the Immigration Board of the Ministry of Home Affairs without any reasons
given. The Legal Assistance Centre represented Frank in her case. Her
applications for permanent residence had been based not only on her
professional contribution to education reform in Namibia but also on her
longstanding lesbian relationship with her Namibian partner. In her
affidavit Frank pointed out that if she was involved in a heterosexual
relationship with a Namibian citizen she would have been able to marry and
thereby gain the constitutional right to reside in Namibia and apply for
Namibian citizenship. Frank argued that because of her sexual orientation
this was not possible and submitted that the Immigration Board had failed
to take this into account. By denying her permanent residence, the
Immigration Board had thus violated her constitutional rights to equality
and freedom from discrimination, her right to privacy and the protection
of the family. 
<p>
The Ministry of Home Affairs did not oppose the application
through the court. Judge Hannah of the High Court ordered the Chair of
the Immigration Board to grant permanent residence to Frank.
The Rainbow Project welcomes this court decision in favour of one of its
founding members. The Project congratulates Liz Frank and her partner for
standing up for their rights as lesbian women in the face of
discriminatory
hate speech directed at the gay and lesbian community of Namibia by
government leaders in recent times. The Rainbow Project is committed to
ensuring that the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered
people
are fully recognised and protected in Namibia. It regards this decision
by
the High Court of Namibia as a mark of recognition of lesbian and gay
relationships. More Information:

<b>ROMANIA</b> (March 27): Romanian lesbian prisoner case -
<br/>Born in 1957, Mariana Cetiner graduated the Sports Institute,
specializing in handball and swimming. She went to the Netherlands in
the period 1991 - 1995 to coach a handball team, after which she
returned to Romania. According to her account, she met in Alba Iulia two
women she lived with for some time. Mariana Cetiner said she loaned Ms
Elena Mih ilescu, who owned a small business, the amount of lei
20,000,000; she even had evidence in this sense, consisting of a
document signed by the beneficiary of the loan and written on a sheet of
paper with the heading of Ms Mih ilescu's business. In the meantime,
Mariana Cetiner was denounced at the Alba Iulia police for having
repeatedly proposed to have sex with Adina Vanea, the other woman with
whom she lived at Ms Mih ilescu's. 
<p>
On 6 October 1995, Mariana Cetiner
was arrested and prosecuted on the basis of art. 200 paragraph 4 (turned
into para. 5 after the Penal Code was modified in October 1996 -
enticing or alluring a person to perpetrate same sex relations) and on
the basis of art. 192 para. 1 (trespassing). 
The Alba Iulia first instance court sentenced her to three years in prison
by criminal
decision no. 715/1996 of 17 June 1996 for the crime provided by the last
paragraph of art. 200, to six months on the basis of art. 192 para. 1
and to denial of certain rights (art. 64 in connection with art. 71 of
the Penal Code); the two sentences were joined and she had to serve the
longest term in prison. At the appeal tried at the Alba Iulia tribunal
in January 1997, Mariana Cetiner was acquitted on both charges and
released on 15 January. The Prosecutor's Office appealed this decision;
the appeal was tried at the Alba Court of Appeal which by final decision
no. 166 of 6 May 1997 confirmed the sentence pronounced by the first
instance and ordered that Mariana Cetiner be arrested again and continue
to serve the tree- year sentence. On 16 May 1997, Mariana Cetiner was
brought back to the Aiud penitentiary on the basis of a pre-trial arrest
warrant for a theft allegedly committed on 12 April 1997 and a warrant
to serve the rest of the sentence pronounced on the basis of arts. 200
and 192.
<p>
Mariana Cetiner said that on 12 April 1997 she went home to Ms Mih
ilescu's to ask back for the money she had loaned her. Ms Mih ilescu
told her she did not have any money, but allegedly offered her a "Orion"
television set worth about lei 2,500,000. When she left, Mariana Cetiner
borrowed a jacket made of synthetic material. After paying a visit to an
acquaintance she went to Bucharest and sold the television set. Elena
Mih ilescu said that she had allegedly fallen asleep from the beer
Mariana Cetiner had brought - suggesting even that she had been drugged,
which the medical examination failed to acknowledge - and that the next
morning she had noticed that the jacket and television set were missing,
so that she went to the police and accused Mariana Cetiner of theft. 
<p> The
Alba Iulia first instance court sentenced Mariana Cetiner to four years
in prison for theft (art. 208 Penal Code) and theft with aggravating
circumstances (art. 209 Penal Code) by means of penal sentence no.
1087/1997. Mariana Cetiner appealed this decision with the Alba tribunal
that incriminated her only on the basis of art. 208 and cut her sentence
to two years in prison, a punishment amnestied in 1997 (decision no.
107/A/1998). The court ordered that the defendant be released. On 9
March 1998, the Prosecutor's Office appealed the decision on grounds of
procedure, not in order to contest the charge and the sentence. As at
the beginning of March 1998 the President of Romania pardoned Mariana
Cetiner's sentence on art. 200 para. 5, she should be released as soon
as the appeal is tried.
<p>
Bad treatments Mariana Cetiner was allegedly subjected to while in
detention -
During the 751 days spent in detention at the Târg or and Aiud
penitentiaries, Mariana Cetiner was punished several times (by severe
isolation included) following wrangles with other detainees or
penitentiary employees. The issue raised again is valid for the whole
penitentiary system: detainees punished for alleged violations of
internal regulations do not have the opportunity to appeal these
punishments outside the penitentiary system. The reports drawn up by
penitentiary employees are approved - or rejected - by penitentiary
commanders or, function of how serious the suggested punishments are, by
he General Department for Penitentiaries. There is no impartial
independent instance able to rule on the detainees' deeds and
punishments.
<p>
Mariana Cetiner stated that she had been beaten by two non- commissioned
officers at the T'rg or penitentiary - so hard that she still had marks
of this beating on the leg and ribs. In Aiud, following a wrangle with a
warden, Valeria  ical, she was kept standing and handcuffed for about
nine hours and repeatedly beaten by non-commissioned officer Ionic
Moldovan. The warden vocally denied these accusations and complained
that Mariana Cetiner had insulted and threatened her several times.
<p>
Conclusions:
APADOR-CH has constantly advocated for the need to repeal art. 200 of
the Penal Code, especially paragraphs 1 and 5, on grounds that they run
counter to the Constitution of Romania and to the European Human Rights
Convention, as well as to the case-law of the Strasbourg Human Rights
Court. The association considers that the sentence pronounced in
theCetiner case on the basis of art. 200 para. 5 is a striking example of
the way the Romanian state -  in this case, the judiciary - does not
respect the international pledges it had made. APADOR-CH reminds that
the Council of Europe asked for the decriminalization of same-sex
relations both upon Romania's admittance as a member of the Council of
Europe and when it suspended monitoring the way human rights are
observed in the country;
- the lack of remedies in cases where detainees are punished for alleged
violations of internal regulations enables the staff to perpetrate
numerous abuses.
<p>
Mariana Cetiner, born in 1957, was abandoned by her mother and grew up in
an orphanage. A sportswoman, at twelve she was transferred to a special
school for athletes. Ultimately she married a Turkish citizen, and lived
in
Istanbul for a time. In 1994-95, she played in a handball team in the
Netherlands. In August 1995 she returned to Romania, settling in the
Transylvanian city of Alba Iulia. She moved into an apartment with a
married woman, Elena Mihailescu; another woman who lived there, Adina
Vana,
"collaborated in commercial business" with Cetiner, according to the
indictment. (Cetiner apparently lent her 4000 DM--about $3000.)

<b>KEARNEY, Neb.</b> -- A United Methodist Church minister, the defendant in a
highly unusual ecclesiastical trial, said Thursday that he was not guilty
of
a charge of violating his denomination's laws by performing a ceremony of
same-sex union for two women at his church last year.
On the first day of his trial, which has drawn the attention of Methodists
and others nationwide, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, 53, senior minister at First
United Methodist Church in Omaha, testified that he conducted a covenant
ceremony for the two women on Sept. 14, 1997.

<b>WASHINGTON</b>-A coalition of lesbian and gay organizations called on the
Campbell
Soup Co. today to sever ties with Green Bay Packers defensive end Reggie
White
over anti-gay and racist remarks he made this week to the Wisconsin
Assembly.

<b>WASHINGTON</b>-By a margin of more than two to one, a solid majority of
American
voters oppose repealing state laws that protect gays and lesbians from job
discrimination, according to a bipartisan poll released today by the Human
Rights Campaign.
The survey found 59 percent of U.S. voters oppose repealing these laws,
including 35 percent who strongly oppose repealing them. Just under one in
four
-- 24 percent-favor repealing such state laws.
Majority opposition to repealing state anti-discrimination laws extends to
every region of the country, the survey found. More than two-thirds of
Western
voters (68 percent) and nearly two-thirds of voters in the Northeast (65
percent) oppose repealing such laws, including 44 percent in both of these
regions who strongly oppose repeal. Even a majority of Southern voters --
51
percent-and North Central voters56 percent-oppose repealing state
anti-discrimination laws.Survey results are based on a national random
sample of 1,010 American adults
who were interviewed from March 4-8, 1998, including a subset of 788
registered
voters. The margin of error for the entire sample was +/- 3.1 percent; for
registered voters, it was +/- 3.5 percent.
Ten states currently include sexual orientation in their
non-discrimination
laws: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Hampshire,
New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin. Federal law and the civil
rights laws of the remaining states do not yet protect Americans from
discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Researchers say they have found the first strong
evidence of a physical difference between lesbians and straight women
- a finding that the inner ears of gay women work more like those of
men.
The discovery adds new support to the theory that sexual orientation
may be predisposed before birth.
The origin of homosexuality has long been a matter of contention. Some
believe it to be a matter of choice, but others - including many gay
people - say it is not choice but biology.
Previous research has found that two parts of the male brain are
different in gay and heterosexual men. Other studies have found that
some genes differ between gay and straight men.
In the study to be published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Texas,
Austin, said they found the inner ears of female homosexuals haveundergone
"masculinization," probably from hormone exposure before
birth.
"Their auditory centers have been masculinized and the presumption is
that so have the sites in the brain that direct sexual preference,"
said Dennis McFadden, the lead author of the study.
It has yet to be proven, however, that there is a specific site in the
brain that directs women to be lesbians, he said.
Dr. Michael Bailey of Northwestern University, said the research is
"compelling" and may be "consistent with the biological origin of
lesbianism."
"The most likely interpretation," he said, "is that this represents
some kind of effect of early hormones on the developing fetus."
Bailey cautioned, however, that the research will not be accepted as
valid until others replicate the experiment.Sandra Witelson, an expert on
brain anatomy and sexual orientation at
McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, said the study supports the
theory that lesbianism may be "related to early factors in brain
development."
The inner ear difference between homosexual and heterosexual women was
detected using a test that measures the function of the cochlea, a key
sound amplifier in the inner ear, said McFadden, a professor of
experimental psychology.
The cochlea amplifier in women is more sensitive than that of men,
giving women an increased ability to detect very soft sounds in a very
quiet room. The test measures a very slight sound that the cochlea
makes when responding to a soft clicking sound.
Females, with their more sensitive cochlea, respond more powerfully to
this test than do men, said McFadden. This is true even among infants.
To test for differences between the sexes, the researchers recruitedmore
than 200 adults divided into four groups: homosexual women and
men, and heterosexual women and men. Some from each of the four groups
were later identified as bisexual. The sexual orientation of the
subjects was determined by questionnaire.
The results, McFadden said, indicated that lesbians had
click-responses that were significantly weaker than those of
heterosexual women. The signal was weaker still for all males, both
gay and straight. Bisexual men and women were in the middle, although
McFadden said there were not enough of these to draw firm conclusions.
What is clear, he said, is that there is a dramatic difference in the
development of the hearing systems of lesbians and of heterosexual
women. It also is known that development of the inner ear is affected
before birth by androgens, a male hormone.
Androgens, said McFadden, may also "alter the brain centers that
produce sexual orientation." But he said researchers have yet to find
a brain structure that determines sexual orientation in women.

British lesbian loses European court case
<b>LUXEMBOURG</b>, Feb 17 (Reuters) - A British lesbian who charged her
employer
with sex discrimination for denying benefits to gay couples that were
available to heterosexuals lost her battle in the European Court of
Justice on
Tuesday.
   Reversing the opinion issued last September by one of its advocate
generals, the court ruled that South West Trains had not violated any
European
Union laws by refusing to grant a travel pass to the woman's female
partner.
   "It reached the conclusion that (EU) law, as it stands at present, does
not
cover discrimination based on sexual orientation," a court statement said.
   The lesbian, Lisa Grant, complained that South West Trains granted
travel
concessions to heterosexual couples in stable relationships, but denied
the
benefit to gay couples.
   Grant, who was represented by Cherie Booth, wife of Prime Minister Tony
Blair, took her case to a British industrial tribunal, which asked the
European court to determine whether the policy violated EU law.
   The advocate-general backed her up, saying the company was
discriminating
on the basis of gender imposing its "own private conceptions of
morality."However, the court said the policy was not prohibited by EU
rules requiring
employers to provide equal pay for men and women since it applied equally
to
workers of both sexes.
   "It found that the concessions are refused to a male worker if he is
living
with a person of the same sex, just as they are refused to a female worker
living with a person of the same sex," the statement said.
   The court added that EU law does not require employers to treat stable
relationships between two persons of the same sex as equivalent to
marriages
and that national laws on that question varied widely.
   It noted that the European Commission of Human Rights did not consider
stable homosexual relationships to fall within the scope of the "right to
respect for family life" under the European Convention on Human Rights.
   However, it said that the EU's new Treaty of Amsterdam would allow the
EU
to legislate against discrimination based on sexual orientation once it is
ratified.

<b>JUNEAU, Alaska </b> (AP) - A judge ruled Friday against Alaska's ban on

<b>REUTERS, February 6, 1998</b>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (Reuters) - The Dutch government said on Friday
it
would allow gay couples to adopt children, provided they met the standards
applied to heterosexual couples.
   Since Jan. 1, same-sex couples have been able to register their
relationships in the Netherlands, gaining equality with married pairs in
everything except adoption.
   "There must be better legal protection of children brought up by two
people
of the same sex. That means adoption must be possible for two people of
the
same sex," the cabinet said in a statement released at the end of its
weekly
meeting.
   Ministers also ruled that the non-biological parent of a child should
be
given a legal say in that child's upbringing.
   "This right is acquired automatically if a child is born within a
registered partnership," the cabinet said.
   It said would review the question of gay marriage in about three years.

<b>PUERTO RICAN ACTIVISTS FIGHT AGAINST CRIMINALIZATION OF SAME-SEX CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS </b> 
Local activists and community organizations have formed a Coalition Against Article 103 and For Privacy Rights and have called for international support of their efforts to amend Article 103 of the Puerto Rican Penal code which criminalizes consensual sexual relationships between persons of the same sex. Local activists have been educating the public about the existence of Article 103 and denouncing this statute as one that encourages discrimination and legitimizes violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons while also violating their constitutional right to privacy.  
At the height of the campaign, Margarita Sánchez de León of the Movimiento Ecuménico Nacional de Puerto Rico (the National Ecumenical Movement of Puerto Rico, MENPRI) turned herself in to the Division of Sexual Crimes of the Department of Justice on November 4, where San Juan District Attorney Ramón Muñiz Santiago declined to prosecute her. The District Attorney informed her that lesbians are incapable of committing sodomy since they lack a "virile member;" he added that he would not prosecute two homosexual men under this statute because there would be no victim. The Justice Department issued a press release on the same day refusing to prosecute the case because Ms. Sánchez had a "personal agenda in delivering her confession."

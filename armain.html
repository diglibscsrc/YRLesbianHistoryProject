<h3>
VI LESBIAN, GAY, TRANSVESTITE, TRANSSEXUAL
AND BISEXUAL PRIDE PARADE
    Buenos Aires, November 1, 1997</h3>
<p>
The following speech was collectively produced by the
organizing committee and read both at the beginning and
at the end of the parade. Speakers: Maria Belen Correa,
Lohanna Berkins, Maria Rachid, Alejandra Sarda,
Julio Talavera and Cesar Cigliutti.

</p>
<p>
        In 1967 the first gay group in Latin America was founded in
Buenos Aires; it was called Nuestro Mundo (Our World). That is why, from
this year on Pride Parade is on November 1st, the date when this group
came out to the public for the first time. Today we celebrate life with
pride,
and repudiate discrimination and violence.
</p>
<p>
        We celebrate because we choose to love according to our desire,
because we are fighting for equal rights, because we achieved an Estatute
forthe city of Buenos Aires recognizing the right to be different and
condemning
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender.
</p>
<p>
        We will keep working to end repressive laws used against us, to
change
this opressive and discriminatory culture and to stop the right to health
from
being
a privilege enjoyed by only a few. We celebrate the fact of being together
in
this
park, at the VI Lesbian, Gay, Transvestite, Transsexual and Bisexual Pride
Parade.
</p>
<p>
        Those thirty years of our history go side by side with the hundred
years of
LGTTB movement's history. The fight for our rights has been alive in the
world
for
a hundred years already. We fight against dictatorships, we fight against
patriarchy,
we fight against repression, we fight against the excluding values
supported by
neoliberalist ideologies, and we keep fighting.the city of Buenos Aires

 In Argentina, we are still facing a murderous police force, politicians
who are
building a system that oppresses us, a segment of the Church that condemns
us
through murderous policies. We repudiate discrimination and violence.

        This is the first year that Carlos Jauregui does not walk with us.
This
parade
shows his presence in these thirty years of history.
</p>
<p>
The following speeches were collectively produced by
activists of each identity and read at the closing ceremony.

LESBIANS (speaker: Bibi Lorenzano)
        For many years, it has been usual to hear lesbians saying we
suffer
double discrimination: as women and as lesbians. But, lesbians do not
suffer
double discrimination. Each one of us suffers so many oppressions that
saying
"double" is just too little.
        Since we were dressed in pink at the maternity ward, society
condemned
us to invisibility, silence, submission, sexism. Today, as women, not only
us
but
many others also repudiate discrimination and violence: ongoing work and
social
discrimination suffered by us as women, domestic violence and sexist
oppressioneverywhere.
        Today, as lesbians, we live in a place where the only valid desire
is
supossed to be heterosexual. A system where you can not be different, nor
say it; a system for which it is not convenient that those differences
might
exist
and dislikes them, that preaches about good and bad, right and wrong, and
discriminates against everything that it hasn't labeled as the only good.
        But we do not live a double oppression. Lesbians are also workers,
some are also Indians, Black, Jewish, some are also retired, young,
mothers,
HIV+, cancer survivors. For that, lesbians do not only repudiate
lesbophobia
but also repudiate today neoliberalism, this economical model that
opresses
us all and that every single political party in power promise to keep in
place;
we repudiate the Church's hypocrisy, we repudiate racism, we repudiate
antisemitism, we repudiate xenophobia and we also repudiate all ideologies
encouraging hate and fundamentalism.
        We celebrate our life as lesbians with pride because something
very important happens when a woman finally discovers and then assumes
in front of others that she is a lesbian. That's the beginning of
visibility
andpower. Change starts when we look for each other, when we unite, ready
to fight for our freedom, our right to love and want other women, and we
set up to build a new and different culture, without exclusions and
violence,
without dominance relationships and hierarchies. A new culture based on
solidarity and respect.
        We call you all to be part of this change.
</p>
<h4>BISEXUAL WOMEN (speaker: Alejandra Sarda)</h4>
<p>
To come out as a bisexual women implies a deep work of honesty and
discrimination. Our second-class citizens status in a world culturally and
econo-
mically dominated by men and male values, is the cause that many times our
relationships with men are born of the need for approval we have been
taught to
feel or of violence exerted against us. Many times, but not necessarily
always.
As complex human beings and not mere victims of oppressions, we also can
choose a man for love and/or desire. And when we choose a woman we are
not sick, nor looking for revenge against anybody: we are making use of
our
freedom and of one of the shapes our desire can take.
 Bisexual women are very diverse. Some of us are married to men and
have women lovers. Others are in a stable relationship with a woman and
have
men lovers. Some for whom the gender of their lover/s is completely
irrelevant.
Swingers. Happy monogamous creatures that limit their desires for the
same/
any other gender to fantasy. Those in love with transgender people. And a
wide etcetera.
        Many people hide their sexual identity out of fear or convenience.
Not everyone who does it is bisexual. And many bisexuals -as well as many
gays and lesbians- show ourselves openly as such in public and in private,
with
all
its implications. In this black/white world, bisexual and transgender's
people
contribution is precisely to make visible all the shades of gray, to
dismantle
the idea that sexual orientation and identity are fixed and admit only two
possibilities (homo/straight, woman/man). A rainbow where each one might,
for a moment, find her/his place. A rainbow that is not a purity scale: no
color is superior to others.
        We are not undefined: we are bisexual women and that is a defi-
nition, too. We do not like anything that moves: we like certain women,
certain men and certain transgender persons. We do not spread AIDS
orpatriarchal values; in both cases, what matters is WHAT you do and not
with WHOM. Right now, we are the smallest and less visible group in
the LGTB tribe. Our wish is to stop being so and have also a bisexual men
speaking on this same platform next year.

<h3>
SOME WAYS OF BEING LESBIAN AND ARGENTINEAN IN
    THE 90s - </h3>
Lesbianas a la
Vista (Lesbians on Sight) started as a group in 1995. Currently they
facilitate three support groups for lesbians
(attended by around 15 people each) and a lesbian abusive relationships
self-help group; appear regularly on the
media; are preparing a breast cancer prevention campaign and are about to
open their own location (shared with
the group Escrita en el Cuerpo).
<p>
<h4>LESBIAN SITUATION IN ARGENTINA - Discussion</h4>
<p>
Luciana Kerner (20,
also a member of Young
Gays and Lesbians Group "Building Our Sexuality" - "On the surface, it
seems things have improved. There is
discrimination in the work place and in the family, we are not suppossed
to talk about the subject, but I think if we
look deeper we see the problem is that most lesbians are very isolated,
they do not tell anyone what they are going
through. In the case of young lesbians, situation is worse because we have
to hide it even more. When the family
finds out, they are severely punished, locked in, forbidden to see their
friends, even taken to far away provinces to
be "cured". They suffer a lot in school, there is severe discrimination in
the schools and a lot a presure too. There
is no sexual education. They are also helpless: it is not legal to leave
your family before being 18. Economical
dependency also means there is no other option but obey your parents."
</p>
<p>
Luisa Peralta (26) - "The farthest away you
go from Buenos Aires, the more you can perceive fear. It is not only about
jobs. In the provinces, they are afraid
to be beaten, to be murdered, to be raped. They have a strong fear to come
out and be at physical risk for doing so.
In spite of that very tangible fear, there is a strong need to go out and
meet others. Few weeks ago, some of us
appeared on a TV programme and we got phone calls from many very distant
places in the country. People who
had never told a soul phoned, just to leave a piece of their lives on the
answering machine. That search makes us
think there is a chance for fear to be overcome in the future."
</p>
<p> Laura Eiven
(29) - "I also think there are many
prejudices amongst ourselves, discrimination for the same reason than in
other places: you want to validate your
own thing to enjoy a certain peace of mind and do not accept differences.
There is discrimination against those
who are working class, against Jewish lesbians, those who go to bar versus
those who do not go, those who have
had relationships with men versus those who have not had them ... May be
we are not coming together more, we
are not fighting for what we have in common because amongst us there is
the same bigotry that can be found in
    mainstream society."</p>
<p>
Fabiana Tron (30) - "Regarding this inside
discrimination I think we have made many
improvements. Sometimes the problem is caused by groups that have been too
radicalized or schematical. Last
week -in the support group- we facilitated a workshop on stereotypes and
we saw that there was less prejudices
amongst those who had just joined, those who did not have much contact
with other lesbians compaired with those
who were suppossed to have a feminist background. They were more prone to
say ' am the Lesbian and anyone
who is unlike me is below.'" 
</p>
<h4>
WHAT DOES BEING LESBIAN MEAN, FOR EACH ONE OF YOU?</h4>
<p> Laura -
When I started as an activist I had a definition that soothed me a lot,
and it went like "to be a lesbian is to be a
woman loving other woman, with an ideology stressing awareness and non
opression". That definition was
perfect, wonderful, but ... the onion got peeled off (laughters). Usually,
you cry when peeling an onion (more
laughter)<br/><br/>
Luisa - I was saying in the group that I am not able to define
what a lesbian is. I identify myself as
lesbian and not as woman then I just say "Lesbians are..." And nothing
else. Because we can love other women,
lesbians, bisexuals. There is always something that is undefinible about
us. <br/><br/>
Fabiana - We are people born with a
"feminine" sex, biological females, who love other biological females and
pursue relationships with them. <br/><br/>
Luisa -
What if it's a transsexual? (laughter) It's a serious problem. <br/><br/>
Fabiana -
True <br/><br/>
Laura - That's onion layer # 10. I feel
that I can atribute my own features to a lesbian, but it doesn't mean a
definition. I might say that being lesbian is to
break the system down, not to take anything as absolute, as definitive,
togo on discovering, to go on challenging
things. I think I have a certain sensitivity to women because I am
lesbian, but may be it is not so. To me, being
lesbian is not to have any certainty, to discover myself loving other
woman made me enter a path of awareness and
from then on I started to question everything, refused to take anything as
a given. <br/><br/>
Luciana - I am a happy person
since I came out. <br/><br/>
Valeria Herrera (21) - To me, being a lesbian means loving another woman. 
Fabiana - To me, it has to do with freedom.<br/><br/> 
Luisa - This definition bussiness sounds problematic to me. Whenever you try to make up
a definition, it always turns out to be oppressive, always ends up having
a rigid boundary and that frightens me. I
would say it is a transitional stage in order to arrive to the time when
nobody will be of any gender and everyone
will just be with whoever they want to be, and that's all. If I do not
think it that way, I suffer. Who is more
lesbian: that one who is with a transsexual lesbian or that other one who
is with a very male-lookingtransgender?
To me, the four of them are equally lesbians. But it's a problem because
you always leave somebody out. Any
definition that starts by saying "lesbians are women", leaves me out. To
leave somebody out is the first step in
oppression, tha t is why
I prefer blurred bondaries, not rigid ones.
</p>
<h4>WHY ARE YOU ACTIVISTS? </h4>
<p>
Laura - To
avoid being oppressed, to feel useful, to be with others -I mean, in the
sense of coming togehter for a cause, I do
not mean to look for girlfriends (laughter) Luciana - Too much work for
that (laughter) <br/><br/>
Laura - I am an activist
because I want to transform things, to change things. To know reality a
bit more, too. <br/><br/>
Fabiana - When I was a
Divinity student I had a very strong Christian worldview, I wanted to be a
minister to help people and because I
firmlybelieved in loving others like thyself and solidarity. Then, to come
out as a lesbian took me a long time and I
spent quite a long time locked in my house, and it was a very pesimistic
time because it was also when the Berlin
wall fell down, together with my socialist utopia .. Then I thought
nothing mattered any longer and, as I could not
change anything, better stayed locked at home. That was useless too,
because I can't stay locked at home thinking
that there are other lesbians out there who are feeling the same way as I
felt 10 years ago. <br/><br/>
Luciana - For many
reasons, one of them that I can't be still. If I were black I would be an
activist against black oppression, if I had
AIDS the same. I am always complaining, denouncing things, but I can not
be seated waiting for things to change
by magic. I complain but I move to change what I can not accept. It all
begins with my own need of not being
alone, of looking for people who feel and think like me. Valeria - For me
it also beings with a personal need, a
need for others, for sharing and then it is useful to other women. Luisa -
I think this society is strongly
death-oriented and, as a person, I can not accept that. In none of its
ways; I do not need to have AIDS to protest
against the situation of people living with AIDS; neither do I need to be
Black in order to protest against the
situation Black people live. What happens is that time is limited and
finite, then you have to choose something to
concentrate your efforts on, because if efforts are diffused you can not
do anything effective. If I could, I would
be involved in thousand of things, from environment to street children, I
would be involved in everything. It's the
least you can do to avoid being robbed of your most precious assett, your
freedom. You can not let them take it
from you. <br/><br/>
Laura - It is because we do not give up. Luciana - The only
struggle that is lost is the one you give up,
said Madres de Plaza Mayo in one of their last Marchas de la Resistencia
[N: Three days long demonstration held
every December, to keep alive the memory of 30,000 people dissappeared
during the last military dictatorship] I
agree with that. 
</p>
<h4>
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A VISIBILITY-ORIENTED GROUP, LIKE
LESBIANAS A LA VISTA IS? WHICH WAYS OF VISIBILITY YOU PRACTICE, PREACH, DO
NOT PREACH, REJECT...?</h4>
<p>
Laura - We always said it was about the visibibility that is possible
for each one of us, with no pressures or
expactations. It was about giving information out, and the most people who
see it, the better. We always respected
each individual process, the freedom of each one. In my work (marketing)
people knows, also in my close family,
my friends are lesbians. But I do have instants of panicking and others
when I care for nothing at all. Panic arises
before the TV cameras, and it is because of my family's pressure. They
asked me not to expose them before their
friends, because otherwise they will be isolated. Last year, for the Pride
Parade, I covered my face. I was very
ashamed of myself. I was ashamed to realize that my mother was ashamed of
me; and - to be honest- I also hated
it, I hated the fact of having to cover myself because of my mother. But I
covered myself and inmediately three
journalists came to ask me why I, from Lesbianas a la Vista, was covered.
Next morning, it was on the most
widely read newspaper in the country. My father phoned me to say that my
mother was very angry; I had told the
journalists that my name was Laura, and my mother recognized me. The funny
thing is that I was on the papers
just because I had decided to cover myself.Luciana - I had the opposite
experience then. Today my family knows
but they did not by then. Everyone who knew me spent the whole Parade
advicing me to cover up, for safety
reasons. I had thought of covering my face, but I could not; when I saw
people masked I realized I could not bring
myself to do it. 
<br/><br/>Fabiana - I was awarded the Visibility Prize by Nx [A
GLTB magazine of mainstream circulation]
due to an act of absolute unconciousness. Suddenly, I found myself
standing by Carlos Jauregui and telling the
crews of all night TV news shows what we were doing there. I had never
thought of doing it. My family lives far
away from Buenos Aires. Two days later, my little niece phones and tells
me "Auntie, I saw you in TV". Only
then I realized my family could have seen me. I apologized to my sister
and asked her what had she told my niece:
"that you were in a gay and lesbian parade; don't worry, when she is older
I will explain everything to her". Few
weeks ago I appeared on a talk show and my grandmother phoned to
congratulate me. She says several neighbors
told her I looked pretty on TV (laughter). My mother offered to phone the
talk show and give her opinions as a
mother. I had been afraid of coming out, but finally it was great.uciana -
Few days ago I went to a radio show for
the first time and I realized it had been much more important and
difficult to me to come out to my family. It's very
important what each one does wherever she is. 
Chela -a group member who is
absent today because she is sick-
always says it's a contradiction to her to be an activist and at the same
time not to be very visible. But in her case
the problem is that she teaches at a high school. I was her student and I
know the way she talks in class: it is as if
she was carrying ten banners! She has a discourse that is completely
challenging and nobody else has it.

There is this confusion about being visible and being public, and they are
absolutely different things. I keep on
thinking the most valuable thing is to be out in the street, to kiss my
lover there, while waiting for the bus. Those
images we can generate are much more powerful than the ones caught by a TV
camera. When I am there, in the
street, I control my own image; in the other case, there is a manipulation
I can never fully control. 
<br/><br/>
Luisa - It is also
in the street where you risk more. It is there where two men might come
suddenly and beat you, not in the TV set.
<br/><br/>Fabiana - Chela always says that being visible is, prior to anything,
to
be able to look at yourself in the mirror; I
love it. 
</p>
<h4>WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL AND GROUP RELATIONSHIP TO THE GLTB
MOVEMENT? </h4>
<p>
Laura -
To me, everything is quite new because I come from a radical feminist
background. I feel I can relate till the point
where I loose my objective, my identity. I have trouble working with men,
I find them more selfish and frivolous
than us - that could be in part prejudice and I felt I had to start
opening up that prejudice too. Mi activism is mostly
connected to facilitating support groups, I do not go to meetings much.
May be it's because I have trouble finding
the common point beyond diversity. That point is not visible yet. I trust
the things we did last year, I trust the
people who are working here, it is all less sectarian than when I used to
work in feminist groups. I can see that
when there is work to do, everybody comes toghether. But I do not feel
involved, I rather feel at the border. I had
a lot of dissappointments, I guess that is why I feel so. 
<br/><br/>
Luciana - What I
like about Lesbianas a la Vista is that we
move with a lot of freedom; it is not necessary for the whole group to
participate in activities with the GLTB
community, we move independently, some take part and others don't. We do
participate as a group in the II
National GLTB Gathering or at demonstrations, but only those we feel
confortable with it joined the organizing
committees. I do participate, a lot. My background is leftist parties and
I am a firm believer in community projects,
I think that union is powerful. The change we try to do will be faster,
and stronger if it is done by all of us,
women and men. I feel I have learnt a lot - I did have no idea what a
tranvestite was like, for instance- but now I
have learnt a lot from the tranvestite activists; a few gays have also
taught me a lot. It is true that sometimes you
loose track of your own objectives or the group's. I would say I am inside
the frontier, inside that something trying to become a movement! !

<h4>
SECOND LESBIAN, GAY, TRANSVESTITE,
TRANSEXUAL AND
BISEXUAL NATIONAL CONFERENCE. Salta, Argentina - 28 y 29 de Marzo de 1997</h4>
<p>
When last year at the Ist
Conference, Salta was chosen as host for the 2nd, we all knew it was a
challenge. And we were right. A few days
before our arrival, a local conservative newspaper wrote about the
perverts ready to invade the city, while
pro-family and christian groups threaten with a human chain to impede our
entrance to the hotel. In that climate,
about 50 activists from Buenos Aires and Rosario arrived in a very
movilized town. Local media covered the
conference all the time; to our surprise, newspapers and TV were serious,
respectful and informative. The
promoted human chain never materialized; on the contrary, people
everywhere showed us solidarity and affection.
As trans activist Lohanna Berkins said to a local media, Salta's socie- ty
proved to be a long way ahead of its
leaders. Police participation was reduced to following our bus wherever it
went and being on duty in front of the
bar where workshops were held.Political pressures made the University to
back off at the last moment. leaving us
without a place for workshops and plenaries. The Conference was then
held at a local gay bar, Nosotros. It was
not at all the most suitable place (several workshops had to be
reformulated) but everyone's good disposition soon
made it seem fitted. Overcoming their fears, local lesbians, gays and
tranvestites attended in growing numbers,
and that was one of the Conference's main achie- vements. By the end, they
almost outnumbered those coming
from other provinces. 
<br/><br/>
Workshops were suitable for all tastes. Young Gays
and Lesbians Group (Buenos Aires)
invited us to a generational exchange, where the elders told how our young
days had been. Marcelo Ferreyra
(CHA, Buenos Aires) promoted the Argentinean glbt movement's history.
Lohanna Berkins and Paula Rodriguez
(ALIT, Buenos Aires) used masks to connect everyone with their "inner
tranvestite". We, Escrita en el Cuerpo,
shared a warm and deep collective reflection on activists' private and
public lives, their conflicts and potentials.
Nestor Talento (Lugar Gay, Buenos Aires) analized gay couples; Cesar
Cigliutti (CHA, Buenos Aires) facilitated
an analysis of new strategies to be implemented be- fore the media, while
Pedro Paradiso (Arco Iris, Rosario)
made us face AIDS and our excuses. For the first time, a workshop brought
together lesbians, bi and trans
women; it was facilitated by Lesbianas a la Vista and its subject was the
diverse constructions of sexual identity.
Two workshops awoke powerful and deep emotions in us all: 100 years of
conscience (Diana Mines, Mujer y
Mujer, Uruguay) - a collective dramatization stating with the dawn of
homosexual movements in Germany and
ending with Sto- newall and today's pride statement in each one of us- and
Zapatos taco aguja (Belen Correa,
ATA, Buenos Aires) an impressing monologue on daily violence forced upon
tranvestites, with later debate. 
    </p>
<p>
Two
"out of schedule" actions became an unforgettable experience for us all,
but mostly for locals. On Friday night,
several of us went to O'Clock, the most elegant gay disco in town. The
owner did not allow local tranvesti- tes to
enter, while not applying the same rule to those from Buenos Aires.The
answer was a very noisy demostration
outside the bar, inviting the pa- trons to join in -which they did. It all
ended with Conference lesbians, gays and
tranvestites at the disco's stage, using microphones to invite everyone to
attend next day's workshops. 
</p>
<p>
On
Saturday night, Salta witnessed for the first time in its history a Pride
Parade. We all marched embracing each
other, preceded by the rainbow flag, first in silence but soon with chants
and slogans. It was very moving to see
local gays, lesbians and tranvestites who just the day before spoke of
their panic to be visible, and now were
proudly marching. </p>
<p>Several important resolutions were agreed upon at this
Conference: 
<br/>* To organize a national
campaign towards an Antidiscriminatory Law espe- cifically mentioning
sexual identity and orientation,
coordinated by a natio- nal coalition of groups and individual (meetings
will be held in Rosario (July) and Buenos
Aires (November). 
<br/>* To celebrate Tranvestite and Transsexual Day, on the
date a trans group stood up for the first
time to defend their rights in Dictatorship times. Nadia Echazu (OTTRA,
Buenos Aires) would like to invite other contries to organize...

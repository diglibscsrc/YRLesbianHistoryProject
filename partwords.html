<h1> Words from invited speakers at Sisterhood Celebration</h1>
<hr/>
<h3>Gloria Steinem:</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Races are only won by long-distance runners and that's what
   Sisterhood is, and that's what we need.... Because as Gerda Lerner
   has always pointed out to us, a movement that doesn't last at
   least a century leaves no impact."</li>
<li>"Sisterhood, like other women's bookstores around this
   country, is really a community center. It's really a place where
   you go to find out that you're not crazy, the system is crazy."
   <li>"It's in our long term interest as readers to make sure that
   Sisterhood and all our independent and especially our feminist
   bookstores continue."</li>
<li>"The minute God looks like the ruling class, you know you're
   in deep shit. I think we should just declare Sisterhood Bookstore
   the first bookstore of the post-patriarchal, post-racist,
   post-nationalist, post-monotheistic age. That was an experiment
   that failed. We're just going to go on from there."
   <li>"Part of what the women's movement is about is becoming each
   other's mothers."</li>
</li></li></ul>
<p>Writer, editor and activist, Gloria Steinem is well-known as a
lecturer, feminist organizer and frequent spokeswoman on issues of
equality. Besides having authored several best-selling books, her
writings have appeared in a large number of anthologies, newspapers
and magazines, including <em>New York Magazine</em>--a weekly she
helped to found in 1968, and for which she was a political columnist
until 1972. Her collection <em>Outrageous Acts and Everyday
Rebellions</em> was re-released by Henry Holt in 1995. Currently, she
is a writer and consulting editor for <em>Ms.</em> magazine, the
international feminist bi-monthly that she co-founded in 1972.</p>
<p>As an organizer, Steinem has helped to found the Women's Action
Alliance, a national Center for information and advocacy; the
National Women's Political Caucus; and the Coalition of Labor Union
Women. She is president of Voters for Choice, an independent
bi-partisan political action committee that supports candidates
working for reproductive freedom, and she is the founding president
of the Ms. Foundation for Women, which supports grassroots projects
that empower women and girls.</p>
<p>Steinem has also co-produced an Emmy-winning TV documentary for
HBO and a original TV movie for Lifetime. She is presently working,
with Rosilyn Heller, on a cable drama about an acquaintance rape case
and a mini-series tracing the women of two families, one white and
one black, from the suffragist/abolitionist era to the beginning of
modern feminism. She has been honored with numerous honorary degrees
and awards for writing and journalism, as well as for her activism.
In 1995, <em>Parenting</em> magazine selected her for its Lifetime
Achievement Award for her work in promoting girls' self-esteem.</p>

<h3>Jackie Goldberg</h3>
<ul>
<li>"It's important for us all to realize that the way things are
   set up in the financial capitalist world is to get rid of
   competition. This in spite of the fact that they love, the
   economists of capitalism, to talk about the fact that it's
   competition that makes it great. But it is really doublespeak of
   the highest order. Because the whole point of most large
   capitalist enterprises is to buy up--and to push out who they
    can't buy--all of the available competition...."</li>
<li>"I can tell you for a fact that when there are no small and
   feminist bookstores like Sisterhood, when you go to those big
   chains, the smaller voices, the more radical voices, the more
   independent voices, the voices of the new writers will not be
   there. They don't make them money and they don't need them. But we
   do. We need them. And they nourish us. They make another
   generation of women and men powerful to resist the gobbledygook
   that passes for small-t truth in our society."</li>
</ul>
<p>Jackie Goldberg was first elected to public office in 1983 as a
member of the Los Angeles Board of Education, where she served until
1991. She was president of the Board from 1989-91. In 1993, Goldberg
was elected to the Los Angeles City Council, where she became its
first openly lesbian Councilmember. Prior to holding public office,
Jackie taught high school in the Compton and Los Angeles Unified
School Districts.</p>

<h3>Maxine Waters</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Books are powerful. It takes us a while to understand all the
   power centers and what has happened historically to keep women in
   their place and how we have been left out and marginalized. For
   those women understood the power of the written word, the power of
   books, and were able to organize a bookstore and to bring that
   power together in wonderful ways with so many women expressing who
   they were and who they are and their thoughts and their visions of
       what they can be."</li></ul>
<p>Congresswoman Maxine Waters--the chair of the 39-member
Congressional Black Caucus and vice chair of the influential
Democratic Steering Committee of the House of Representatives--is
considered by many to be one of the most powerful women in American
politics today. She has gained a reputation as a fearless and
outspoken advocate for women, children, people of color and poor
people. Elected to her fourth term in the House of Representatives,
Congresswoman Waters represents California's 35th District, which
includes a large part of South Central Los Angeles, as well as
Gardena, Hawthorne and Inglewood. As a member of the House Banking
committee, Rep. Waters has won provisions to give women and
minority-owned firms preference in acquiring failed financial
institutions in under-served areas.</p>
<p>Prior to her election to the U.S. House of Representatives in
1990, Congresswoman Maxine Waters , who served 14 years in the
California State Assembly, had already attracted national attention
for her "no nonsense, no-holds barred" style of politics. She was
responsible for some of the boldest legislation California has ever
seen, including landmark affirmative action legislation which opened
up state procurement and contracting opportunities to women- and
minority-owned businesses. She also created the nation's first
statewide Child Abuse Prevention Training Program.. She has served on
the Democratic National Committee since 1980 and has been a key
leader in several presidential campaigns. She is a co-founder of the
Black Women's Forum, a nonprofit organization of over 1,200 African
American women in the Los Angeles area and has been a grassroots
leader on several local projects. Long active in the women's
movement, Rep. Waters has given encouragement and financial support
to women seeking public office.</p>

<h3>Sheila Kuehl</h3>
<ul>
<li>" People who write: there is something so dangerous about
   them, so wonderfully, wonderfully dangerous!"</li>
<li>"As you know, we have to come out to be known. And it's very
   much the same with feminism: we had to come out about it. And it
   was dangerous, and it was risk-taking and it was so wonderful. I
   mean, we really did believe that we would get hurt, we believed we
   might be physically hurt, and many, many, many of us were."</li>
<li>"The right wing is really, really afraid of many, many things.
   But I have to tell you one of them is the ability of young people
   to read."</li>
<li>"There is an enormous fear that our young people will learn
   their real history and how to think for themselves. I mean, a free
   education is really a threatening thing to fascism.</li>
<li>"Feminism, unlike many other theories of social organization,
   is truly a transformational set of theories.</li>
<li>"I love science fiction, which incidentally in my opinion is
   one of the great feminist genres in the world today."</li>
<li>"You must take power in every arena that affects peoples's
   lives. You must never say to me, 'Oh, I don't want to run for
       office. It's too dirty.' Like what <em>you</em> do isn't..."</li></ul>
<p>Sheila James Kuehl, now in her second legislative term in the
California State Assembly, is the first woman to be named Speaker pro
Tempore of that body. A former pioneering civil rights attorney and
law professor, Ms. Kuehl represents the 41st Assembly District in Los
Angeles County. She chairs the Select Committee on California's Women
and serves on the California Coastal Conservancy, the State
Commission on the Status of Women, the Domestic Violence Program
Advisory, and the Select Committee on Entertainment and the Arts as
well as on the Appropriations, Higher Education, Human Services,
Judiciary and Information Technology Committees.</p>
<p>During her first term in the Assembly, Ms. Kuehl authored 23 bills
that were signed into law to further protect domestic violence
victims and their children, tighten child support enforcement,
prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientation
in the workplace and in education, safeguard the environment, and
increase the rights of crime victims. Last year <em>George</em>
magazine selected her as one of the twenty most fascinating women in
politics.
<p>Prior to her election to the Assembly , Ms. Kuehl drafted and
fought to get into California law more than forty pieces of
legislation relating to children, families, women, and
discrimination. She was a law professor at Loyola, UCLA and USC Law
Schools and co-founded and served as managing attorney of the
California Women's Law Center. She also served as President of the
Women Lawyers' Association of Los Angeles and as a member of the
California Supreme Court's Advisory Committee on Gender Bias in the
Courts. In her youth, she was known for her role as Zelda Gilroy in
the television series "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis."</p>

<h3>bell hooks</h3>
<ul>
<li>"The heartbeat of women's bookstores is feminism and feminist
   politics. In so many ways, it's a triumph of feminism that places
       like Borders are trying to compete."</li>
<li>"I remember 25 years ago when places in the mainstream would
   not carry our books, so that first and foremost feminist
   bookstores were the true embodiment of democratic freedom of
       speech."</li></ul>
<p>bell hooks is the author of fifteen books, including <em>Killing
Rage</em>, <em>Ain't I a Woman</em>, and <em>Bone Black: Memories of
Girlhood</em>. Born in Kentucky and educated at Stanford and UC Santa
Cruz, hooks now lives in New York City, where she is Distinguished
Professor of English at City College in New York. hooks' brilliant
writings explore feminist issues with courage and insight. As Dr.
Maya Angelou notes, "Each offering from bell hooks is a major event,
as she has so much to give us." Her latest book, <em>Wounds of
Passion: a Writing Life</em>, has recently been published by Henry
Holt and Company.</p>
<p>The opening lines of the preface of hooks' new memoir speak to the
theme of today's event and the relevance of her participation:</p>
<p>"To be born a girl in the fifties and years before was to enter a
world where folks still believed that the most important event of a
young woman's coming of age was marriage. Those of us who were not
fantasizing about a white wedding and the man of our dreams knew we
were freaks. We knew better than to speak our longings. From age ten
on I dreamed of becoming a writer. Books were my ecstasy and just as
I wanted to curl up in my tiny attic room bed and be transported far
away, I dreamed of writing words that would offer someone else the
same pleasure."</p>

<h3>Emily Levine</h3>
<ul>
<li>"In law, you take an enormous, complex problem like crime and
   reduce it to a baseball slogan: 'Three strikes and you're out!'
   This is where, also, men have the edge, of course. If women had
   known, if we had called it a 'personal foul' instead of 'sexual
       harassment...'"</li>
<li>"I think [Freud] is right about penis envy. I think there is
       such a thing. I think he's wrong about who has it."</li>
<li>"Tweny-five years ago I had a man say to me, 'I will consider
   women my equals the day they can stand up next to me in line and
   piss against a wall....' You wonder what kind of great thinking
   comes out of a statement like that. Possibly the trickle-down
       theory..."</li></ul>
<p>In addition to her numerous appearances as a comedienne, Emily
Levine has worked in television as a writer/producer, working on
shows such as "Designing Women" and "Love and War." She is currently
with Norman Lear's Act II Productions at Paramount where she is
writing a pilot for NBC. Cited as one of the new "Queens of Comedy"
by <em>Newsweek</em> magazine, Emily has performed on a number of
television shows, including "Late Night With David Letterman."</p>

<ul>
<li>"Does anybody in this place not know why you're here today?"
   <li>"Before the Internet, there was the women's net, and
   Sisterhood Bookstore was there at the beginning to organize the
   community, keep it running and keep it informed. Thank Goddess,
       Sisterhood is still with us!"</li></li></ul>

<h3>Michele Sernos</h3>
<ul>
<li>"When <em>Chicana Falsa</em> was first published, the press
   folded. I remember having a stack of 1000 books and nowhere to go,
   and I piled them into my Honda, and I was going from bookstore to
   bookstore. I remember right away going to the chain bookstores,
   not really knowing where to take these books, and was met with so
   much question, so much negativity. I took the books to Sisterhood
   Bookstore. I remember Adele taking my bio.... She was very
   receptive and very supportive, and I want to thank you so much for
       that. It meant so much to me."</li></ul>
<p>Chicana writer Michele Serros had her first book, <em>Chicana
Falsa and Other Stories of Death, Identity and Oxnard</em>, published
when she was a UCLA undergraduate. Her poetry and short stories have
also been included in several anthologies, and her second book,
<em>How to be a Chicana Role Model</em>, is slated for publication by
Riverhead books. An award-winning commentator on public radio,
Michele's performances have been described as "part poetry reading,
part stand-up comedy, part theatrical event."</p>

   worst nightmare!"</font>
<li><font color="#000000">"Remember we used to be the gay
   movement? And then the gay and lesbian movement? And then the
   gay-lesbian-bisexual movement? Now it's the
   gay-lesbian-bisexual-transgender movement. I had to gain thirty
       pounds to get everybody on my t-shirt!"</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000">"The radical right still thinks that
   homosexuality is a disease. If homosexuality is a disease, we

       queer."</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000">"Jerry Falwell...thinks global warming
       was caused by the AIDS quilt."</font></li>
<li><font color="#000000">"Thank you, Sisterhood.... Thank you for
   being there before being a lesbian and being a feminist was so
   commercial. Thank you for all of your hard work. Just thank you.
       Thank you for being our sisters."</font></li>

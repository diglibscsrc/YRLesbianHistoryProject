<p>
Barbara has been an activist since 1958, "when there were scarcely two
hundred of us in the whole United States. It was like a club - we all knew
each other." In 1958 she established the first East Coast Chapter of the
first known lesbian organization in the United States, The Daughters of
Bilitis (DOB - founded in 1955 in San Francisco). She later edited THE
LADDER,
DOB's national magazine (1956-1972) from 1963 to 1966. She subtitled it "A
Lesbian Review" and introduced photo covers of gay women.
<p>
She marched in the first gay rights picket lines in the mid 60s at the
White House and The Pentagon (Washington) and Independence Hall
(Philadelphia). "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a
popular tactic at the time, and our cause seemed outlandish even to
most gay people." She was a charter member of the Boards of Directors of
the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (founded 1973) and the Gay Rights
National Lobby (founded 1976), which was the forerunner of the Human
Rights Campaign.
<p>
From 1971 to 1986, she headed the Gay Task Force of the American Library
Association and edited its "Gay Bibliography" and other gay reading
lists. She wrote a brief history of the group called "Gays in Library
Land" which was published in 1990 and is reprinted in DARING TO FIND
OUR NAMES (1998). She also starred in the first-ever gay
kissing booth, called "Hug a Homosexual." The booth was run by the gay
librarian's group at the 1971 national convention of librarians.
<p>
In the 1970s, she produced several gay exhibits at conventions of the
American Psychiatric Association (such as "Homophobia:Time for Cure" and
"Gay Love
is Good Medicine"). She was also a fairy godmother to the emerging 
caucus of lesbian and gay psychiatrists.  
<p>
She has addressed over 350 audiences, gay and non-gay, and especially
enjoys running workshops such as "Lavender Leverage:How You Can Make a
Difference" and lecturing on "Gay and Smiling:Tips From My 40 Years As a
Gay Activist."
<p>
She served for three years on the Board of the Delaware Valley Legacy
Fund,
which promotes and directs philantropy to benefit the local gay/lesbian
community. She is on  the advisory board of the Philadelphia
Lesbian and Gay Task Force, and on the Endowment Commitee for the Hormel
Center Gay and Lesbian Library at the San Francisco Public Library. She is
a member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays, The Human Rights Campaign, the gay TV
show "In the Life (which includes memberships), and the ACLU. 
<p>
She appeared in the classic documentary "Before Stonewall" (1987) and is
featured in the documentary "Out of The Past (1998).
<p>
She and her long-time partner Kay Tobin Lahusen are currently trying
to organize forty years' worth of movement memorabilia -
correspondence, artifacts, publications, photographs, and much more - for
future distribution to various gay/lesbian archives.
<p>
Barbara says: 
 "I continue to march, to boost the cause,
to give practical help, and to cheer other activists and supporters."

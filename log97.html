<b>CAPETOWN </b> - (December) 
Amnesty International decided to increase the visibility of its work on
human rights violations on the grounds of sexual orientation, but at the
same time supporters of the motion to add "sexual orientation" to its
mission statement shelved it fearing defeat.  Preceding that decision,
there was "a difficult discussion," according to an Amnesty insider.

As an annex to the home for elderly people "de Rietvinck" in the Amsterdam
Jordaan area the "L.A. Ries huis" will be built consisting of 7
appartments for
elderly gay women and men. Mr. L.A. Ries was a highranking and highly
succesfull Dutch civil servant who in the 30's was made to resign after a
17-year old man accused him of having seduced him after having been
arrested by
Dutch police for a different crime. The accusations later proved to be
false
but Ries was dismissed from his post, mainly because liberal statesman Mr.
Oud
strongly objected to his staying on. Some 40 people have already applied
for
one of the appartments in the Mr. L.A. Ries huis, 30 of which are from gay
men
and 10 from lesbians. The houses are expected to be finished in the summer
of
1998 and are the result of several studies into the situation of elderly
gay
men and women in Holland which concluded that especially among senior
citizens
there still is a lot of resentment and discrimintaion against gays, even
in
non-christian homes for the elderly.

<b>LESBIAN PRIEST STIRS STORM IN NORWAY</b><br>
By Alister Doyle<br><br>
<b>OSLO</b>, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A Norwegian lesbian priest who ``married'' her
female lover in defiance of church rules triggered a storm of controversy
in Norway's parliament on Wednesday.
   Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, himself an ordained priest in
Norway's state Lutheran church, defended Church Affairs Minister Jon
Lilletun for saying that the priest, Siri Sunde, should resign.
   ``I don't think it's improper for the minister to react now,'' Bondevik
said during question time, adding that Lilletun ``also made clear that the
church itself would deal with this.''
   Bondevik also noted that Bishop Rosemarie Kohn, Norway's first female
bishop, who ordained Sunde, felt the priest had broken a promise by
entering
a legal gay marriage this year with her lesbian partner.
   Norway's church allows women to become priests but bars active gays --
those living with a homosexual partner -- from doing so.
   Lilletun said at the weekend that he believed that Sunde, suspended
pending a ruling by the church hierarchy next month, should resign.
   Bondevik, who came to power last month in a minority coalition,
laughter in parliament by saying that Lilletun had only made his remarks
because he was asked about Sunde by a reporter for Norway's NTB news
agency.
   Norway is among the few nations to allow same-sex marriages and
recognises gay partnerships in terms of property ownership, taxation,
pensions, social benefits, inheritance and divorce. Under the 1993 law,
they are barred from adopting children.
   Left-wing parliamentarians criticised Lilletun for giving his blessing
to the church's opposition to homosexuality when Norwegian laws banned
discrimination against gays in hiring and firing employees.
   Grete Knudsen of the opposition Labour Party said  Lilletun had put
``improper pressure'' on Sunde.
   ``Doesn't the prime minister think it's a huge problem if the church
sends out the signal to most people that homosexuals are not welcome in
church?,'' asked Kristin Halvorsen, head of the Socialist Left party.
``That's the signal if Sunde leaves her job.''
   Inge Loenning of the Conservative party also criticised the government
for taking clear opposition to Sunde ``when it has the political stance
that one should not intervene in such cases.''
   A meeting of church leaders earlier this month decided to uphold a ban
in principle on homosexuals in non-religious jobs, ranging from Bible
readers to bell-ringers and organists. But it allowed bishops leeway to
enforce it or not in their own dioceses.

"Today is a very sad day for California's lesbian, bisexual and gay

Dear Editors: I have been in <b>San Antonio</b>, as a tourist and as an invited
guest of academic insitutions, twice in the past several months. My visit
some months back followed on the heels of the Color Purple scandal, as we
in the hinterlands of California have labelled the scandal Sandra Cisneros
caused by painting her house a traditional Mexican color. I was appalled
to learn of yet another controversy involving women of Mexican origin, and
as a scholar with an interest in this topic and some publications to my
name on the subject of anti-Mexican, anti-Chicana sentiment, I have
followed the recent de-funding of the Esperanza Center with great and
grave interest.
In the press, San Antonio is looking less and less like
the cultural trendsetter and more like a city unable to grapple with the
unique values, contributions, and methods of people rarely visible---until
recently---to the mainstream. Mr. Roddy Stinson's editorial of September
13, 1997, reaffirms my point. Mr. Stinson decries the fact that such
cultural institutions as the Esperanza Center are indeed changing the look
of the city, and he quotes from the advertisement for Monica Palacios'
visit. Palacios is a Chicana lesbian performer from Los Angeles, and will

WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> (The Washington Blade, September 12, 1997)
by Loree Cook-Daniels
Last month Kate Kendall, executive director of the National Center for
Lesbian Rights, reported some extremely sad news. NCLR's caseload now
has more Lesbian mom vs. Lesbian mom child custody cases than it does
straight parent vs. Gay parent cases.
We're all familiar with the type of heterosexual vs. Gay parent cases NCLR
takes on. In these cases, the straight parent argues that simply by being
Gay, the Lesbian or Gay male parent is detrimental to the child(ren) and
therefore should be denied custody and/or visitation. In NCLR's Lesbian
mom vs. Lesbian mom cases, one mother says - quite simply - that the
other mom shouldn't have custody and/or visitation because she isn't
really
a mom. The child(ren) don't carry her genes, so she isn't really their
parent. (Gay and Lesbian Parents Coalition International)

  LONDON</b>, Sept 11 (Reuter) - A government minister on Thursday became the
first British member of parliament to come out publicly as a lesbian.
   Junior environment minister Angela Eagle, 36, said she felt the time
was
right to be open about her sexuality.
   ``I have a long-term and very happy relationship,'' Eagle said in an
interview with The Independent newspaper. ``I happen to be with a woman.''
   An admission of lesbianism might have been expected to be politically
damaging in Britain, where politicians' sex lives are expected to be
beyond
reproach.
   But Eagle said she had received huge support from her family and from
the leadership of the ruling Labour Party.
   ``To be honest I didn't expect anything else,'' Eagle said. ``Attitudes
have changed...I think people are a lot more sensible than we give them
credit for.
   ``I think I've only been able to cope with that because I have a very
understanding family. My sister, my brother and my father, all of whom are
heterosexual, have always supported me.''
<br>
 Eagle's twin sister Maria is also a member of parliament.
   Eagle, elected to parliament in 1992, said she had decided to come out
openly as a lesbian to deal with it herself and ``to get a handle on this
job and to make sure I can do it properly.
   ``Now I am at the stage where I just need to get things sorted so I can
just concentrate on my work.''
   Eagle does not intend to bring her girlfriend, whom she did not
identify
in the interview, to official functions.
   ``My partner is actually very busy with her own life,'' Eagle said.
   Prime Minister Tony Blair was seen as being anxious to remove the
public
stigma of homosexuality when he appointed Chris Smith, who is openly gay,
to
the cabinet post of Culture Secretary.

CHINA</b> - August -
     A growing number of Americans are paying $3,000 to adopt a Chinese
orphan baby girl, a Hong Kong newspaper said on Sunday.
     The Sunday Morning Post said demand was so high that the United
States
Consulate in the south China city of Guangzhou had set up an adoption unit
staffed by a State Department officer to handle the babies' immigration
applications, the first of its kind in an American overseas mission.
     The adoption process cost some US$15,000, including the US$3,000 paid
to the orphanages in exchange for the child.
     More than 3,300 infants from China were expected to be adopted by
U.S.
citizens in the current fiscal year, up from 2,901 children in 1995, the
newspaper said, quoting U.S. consulate figures.
     Officials said about 95 percent of adopted children were girls,
abandoned by parents who preferred to have a boy under China's one-child
policy.
     Most male children available for adoption had disabilities, it said.
     China's flexible adoption policy allows childless people over 35 to
adopt healthy babies and those who are younger can apply for ``special
needs'' children with disabilities or disfigurements. It also does not
require them to be married, as many countries do.
     The newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying ``a fair number'' of
homosexuals, mostly women, were taking children from China, and ``quite a
lot'' of single women, believed to be focused on careers, were also
adopting.
     The newspaper said adoption agency representatives had reported an
improvement in the health of children since a 1995 television documentary
alleged that orphans in China were ill-treated.

<p> 

"Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture" is a project conceived by NWC
Art Caucus Chair, Nancy Cusick, and NWC Co-chair, Mal Johnson, which
provided a unique opportunity for artists worldwide to participate in
the dialogue of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women held in
Beijing.  The project, co-sponsored by The National Museum of Women in
the Arts, invited women artists to create works of art that expressed
their visions of the problems and solutions that shape the lives of
women and girls in today's society.
</p>
<p>   
Cusick and Johnson, with the support of NWC and many others, took the
Collection to Beijing (1995) where it was exhibited at the NGO Forum and
during the official Conference.
Immediately following the close of the Beijing Conference, a selection
from the exhibit traveled to Moscow where it was exhibited for a month
at Moscow's Elite Gallery.  A second selection of 200 pieces was
exhibited for four months in the art gallery of the United States
Department of Health &amp; Human Services in Washington D.C. at the
invitation of HHS Secretary Donna Shalala.
The Collection hung in The Museum of Women in the Arts from March 1996
through June 1996, and in 1997, 300 selected pieces were exhibited at
a Detroit museum and gallery.
</p>
<p>    
The 20th Anniversary Celebration of the historic Houston Women's
Conference is a fitting time to present the last public exhibit of
"Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture" as it takes its place in the
Archives of The National Museum of Women in the Arts, the only museum
in the world devoted exclusively to recognizing the works of women
artists.

Focus: Women in Art and Culture".
</p>
<p>   
The 20th Anniversary Celebration of the Spirit of Houston will kick
off amidst memories of the 1977 Houston Conference, which attracted
20,000 men and women, and visions of the 21st Century.  The National
Women's Conference has named the Honorable Bella S. Abzug, former
Congresswoman, current President of the Women in Environment and
Development (WEDO), guide and mentor to women worldwide, to serve as
Honorary Chair of the 20th Anniversary Celebration.  The Conference
will be held in Washington, D.C. at the Georgetown University
Conference Center November 20-23, 1997.
</p>
<p>   
Ms. Abzug maintains an unwavering struggle for a world where women
participate fully and equally in all aspects of life.  She works
tirelessly to give voice and visibility to women worldwide by forging
links and partnerships at every level.  Abzug encourages women to
achieve equality through economic, social and political empowerment.
While serving in the United States Congress representing New York,
Congresswoman Abzug introduced a bill in 1975 proposing that a
national women's conference be held as part of the Bicentennial
celebration and other women members of the House of Representatives
united with her to work toward the adoption of the legislation.  Under
the onslaught of this determined group, Public Law 94-167 passed in
the House on December 10, 1975 and by the Senate on December 23, 1975.
Public Law 94-167 directed a 42-member National Commission, presided
over by Bella Abzug, to convene a National Women's Conference,
preceded by state and regional meetings.  The mandate read in part:
"...The Conference shall ...recognize the contributions of women to
the development of our country ...assess the role of women in
economic, social, cultural and political development ...identify
barriers that prevent women from participating fully and equally in
all aspects of national life and develop recommendations for means by
which such barriers can be removed....".   Although it amounted to
less than one nickel for each female in the country, Congress
appropriated $5 million to carry forth the mandate of the Public Law.But
women know how to "make do", and Bella Abzug led the nation's
women in that effort.
After a year of hard work and devotion to the task, Presiding Officer
Bella Abzug stood at the podium on November 19, 1977 and extended a
welcome to three First Ladies, whose sheer presence was more moving
than anyone would have imagined.  First Ladies Rosalynn Carter, Betty
Ford and Lady Bird Johnson expelled any notion that they were
ceremonial wives.  They said they were women who could speak for
themselves.  Lady Bird Johnson said she had come to believe that the
women's movement belongs to women of all ages.
Ms. Abzug was a key organizer at the Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing in 1995.  During the Conference, she received
numerous awards and accolades that recognized her many contributions.
Prior to the Beijing Conference, in 1994, she was inducted into the
National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York where the
first women's rights meeting was held in 1848.Bella Abzug is a civil
rights attorney and has earned recognition as a
leading women's rights advocate and public speaker.  She is the
founder of WEDO, an international network with consultative status at
the United Nations.  WEDO networks organize women's caucus meetings at
major international conferences of particular concern to women...
</p>
<p>
In keeping with the NWC Conference theme "Looking Back.....Moving
Forward", we look back to the 1977 Spirit of Houston Conference where
the Exhibit Hall was located in one wing of the Convention Center.
20,000 people visited 231 booths, 22 government agency exhibits, 80
non-profit organizations' displays and 40 women-owned and operated
businesses.  Women in the arts, women publishers and women in the
recording industry were among the exhibitors.  Activist groups of
every persuasion handed out literature and tried to win converts.
Delegates wanted to spend more time in the exhibit area and at the
festival of women's activities, but found it impossible to divide
their time among so many things to do and see.  Some non-delegates
spent the entire conference in the exhibit area without getting around
to all of the events.  For many, the Spirit of Houston will be
remembered as the sights and sounds of Seneca Falls South.

<b>FORMER YUGOSLAVIA</b> -
 For the first time in history 40 lesbians from Croatia,
Serbia,         Macedonia and Slovenia have gathered together on the
meeting
        LESBIAN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.  This was an incredible
meeting         in which most of the women have been free to talk
about their lesbian         existence for the first time in their
lives.
        The meeting started first morning in the woods where lesbians
        stood together in a circle and told eachother I am a lesbian
        in her language and then we all shouted the same sentence
many         times over and over again.  For some of the lesbians it
was a
        first time to feel and say that sentence over and over again.
        The workshops in which lesbians exchanged their experience
were:         -coming out stories -lesbian sexuality
        -legal issues of lesbian movement
        -lesbian identities
        -history of lesbians in Slovenia, 10 years ofactivities
        -lesbian poetry
        -organziing lesbian groups

        Apart from that video nights were organized inwhich we saw
        documentary movie about the Second Lesbian Week in Italy, held
in Bologna in May 19976.  Then documentary about International
Day of Activites Agaisnt Male Violence ASgainst Women, organzied
by feminsit lesbian group of Slovenia, Kassandra, then the
        famous When the Night is Falling.
        Durong the day we were worksing int he workshops during the
        nights lesbians were singing old bosnian croat and serb
songs..         until the dawn.  Excited to be together.  Happy tobe
fre at
        least for five days!  The last day a worksing group was formed to
make a Final

From the meeting of  Lesbians  of  the states of former Yugoslavia
LESBIAN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS
held in Pohorje, Slovenia
from 24th - 30th June, 1997.
<br><br>
                    Forty five lesbians from Novi Sad, Ljubljana,
Maribor, Belgrade, Skopije, Zagreb, and Split, gathered in Pohorje in
order to exchange experiences in this unique way for the first time in
history. The aim of our encounter was:
                    To strengthen the support, relationships, andlesbian
solidarity between us.
                    To discuss and deepen feminist and lesbian
theories.                     To support new initiatives of  lesbian
organizing, especially in places where they  don't  exist.
                    In these six days we listened to one another and
we heard different experiences of the complexities of  lesbian
existance in hetero-patriachal society. It was not easy, and it was
beautiful.
                    We worked through workshops (coming out, lesbian
identity, lesbian parenting, sexuality, legal aspects of the lesbian
movement in Europe, etc.) which enabled us to encourage eachother in
our lesbian identities in order to enforce our private lives and
political activities.
                    It was clear that we overcame our national and
state borders and met each other through experiences of our lesbian
existance.                     It was confirmed that hatred against
lesbians through social, state, and cultural institutions is also part
of our private lives. Liberation of homophobia is a process in whichwe
need eachother.                     In the middle of the forest,
singing, juggling, screaming, dancing, enjoying
We agreed
          - that we will collaborate with eachother because we wish to
- that we will cintinue to meet eachother once a year
          - that we will work on lesbian visibility in all places
          - that we will support eachother in forming new
groups and in other political activities in the promotion of lesbian
human rights
          - that we will form a feminist lesbian working group
which will analize the political system in the former state of
Yugoslavia, and make a plan of action for different ways to be fully
recognized as citizens.

<b>ENGLAND </b> - July <br>
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE TO ARGUE GAY CASE
<br>
The wife of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, attorney Cherie
Booth, will argue a landmark gay-equality case before the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg July 9.
She represents railway clerk Lisa Grant who is suing for spousal
benefits for her lover.
According to the BBC, "the case could prove embarrassing for Tony
Blair as the new government is set to fight a gays-in-the-
military case later this year based on the same point of European
law ... the European Equal Treatment Directive."
If Grant wins, employers throughout Europe will be barred from
treating gay and straight employees differently. Grant's
employer, South West Trains, provides reduced-fare tickets only
to employees' opposite-sex spouses or partners.
The European Court of Justice is the supreme court of the
European Union, 15 western European nations working toward
unification.

<p>
<b>LUXEMBOURG </b> July (Reuter) - Attorney Cherie Blair, the chic, high-flying
wife
of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, argued before the European Court of
Justice Wednesday that a gay couple should be treated the same as a
heterosexual one.
   In formal court wig, black skirt and gown, and making her first
appearance
before the Luxembourg-based court, a poised Blair -- known professionally
as
Cherie Booth -- told the 15 judges at a hearing that the case was based on
the ``fundamental right to equal pay between men and women.''
   The case involves Lisa Grant, an employee of Britain's South West
Trains
(SWT), who claims that the company's refusal to grant a travel pass worth
1,000 pounds ($1,680) for her female partner Jill Percey, broke European
rules on equal pay. Grant says the travel benefit amounted to part of her
wages.
   ``But for the fact she was a woman, Lisa Grant would have been 1,000
pounds better off a year,'' Booth told the court, adding that Grant's
predecessor, a man, had received the travel benefit while cohabiting with
a
woman.SWT's rules stated that privilege tickets were granted for a member
of
staff's spouse and also for a partner of the opposite sex. But the company
refused to give the benefit to Grant because her partner was not male.
   Booth -- a mother of three who earns double her prime minister
husband's
salary -- picked up her career at the bar two months ago after Blair's
Labor
Party swept into power.
   She has sought to keep her two roles distinct and struggled Wednesday
to
avoid press photographers at the Luxembourg court, an institution whose
rulings were often vilified by the Eurosceptic Conservative government
ousted
by her husband.
   Blair told the court SWT's policy was based on ``sexual stereotyping''
and
was ``a further example of making assumptions about the role of women.''
   She argued that the Grant case should be decided on the basis of gender
discrimination alone, though added the court could also declare in
principle
if discrimination due to sexual orientation was covered in the legal
article
in the Treaty of Rome dealing with equal pay for men and women.
   ``It can't be right for employees to be paid less because of their
sexual
orientation,'' she said.
   Nicholas Underhill, representing SWT, urged the judges to
``resistapproaching the case in this broad manner.'' He said the issue was
not that
Grant was a woman but that she and her partner were of the same sex.
   A fundamental question for the courts was whether homosexual couples
were
comparable ``like for like'' with man and wife couples, Underhill said,
adding that the concept of gender and sexual orientation were different,
and
that EU law on equal pay was only concerned with the basic man-woman
relationship.
   An Advocate General of the European court is due to give his opinion on
the case on Sept. 30, and a final ruling is not expected until early next
year. The case will then go back to a British industrial tribunal, which
referred to the European Court for an interpretation of law.

According to Amnesty International in London the following is what
happened
when Demet Demir, a transgender person  was arrested:
It is reported that Demet Demir intervened when police were beating a
young
migrant girl selling paper handkerchiefs on Istiklal street. She picked
the
girl up and criticized the police. The police started to beat her quite
severely and detained her. She was taken to Beyoglu POlice Bureau and
beaten again before being put in a cell for men. She complained saying
that
she had had a sex change operation and wanted to be put in the cell for
women. Eventually this was done. When they learned that DD had received a
human rights prize, they were rather apologetic. A lawyer was called from
Istanbul Bar Association. Medical evidence of the beating was collected -
a temporary medical certificate reportedly recording signs of beating was
issued, and a formal complaint of ill-treatment was entered. The lawyer
will pass Amnesty International the documents in due course, and we will

THE DALAI LAMA MEETS WITH LESBIAN AND GAY LEADERS 
<br>
In a historic meeting in San Francisco on June 11, His Holiness the Dalai
Lama, for the first time ever, discussed issues of homosexuality, human
rights and Buddhism with a small group of gay and lesbians leaders. His
Holiness expressed his strong opposition to discrimination and violence
against gay and lesbian people. He voiced his support for full human
rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. The Dalai Lama was
moved by personal stories of loss and discrimination related by the
participants, and urged respect, tolerance, and compassion for all. He
made it clear that gay and lesbian activists could rely &gt;on general
Buddhist principles as a foundation for their struggle for full
equality.
<br><br>
"His Holiness the Dalai Lama's support for our rights is very
significant," said Tinku Ali Ishtiaq, co-chair of the International Gay
and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. "The Nobel Laureate commands
tremendous respect among people of the world and is highly respected for
his words of wisdom. I hope that his message of non-discrimination
andrespect for our rights will have considerable impact on non-Buddhist
religious traditions as well." (Source: QueerPlanet)

<b>NIGERIA </b>April -
Anti-Lesbian Rapes
<br>
The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission recently
confirmed reports of the rape of four Nigerian lesbians in Calabar in
September of 1994. The four women had sought refuge at a feminist center,
when an unknown number of men attacked the center and raped them at gun
point. Just a few days earlier, one of the critically injured survivors
had
published an article on lesbianism in Nigeria in which she traced the
advent of Nigerian lesbianism and condemned previous attacks against the
center.
<br>
The reporting of these September 1994 attacks sheds crucial light on the
often undocumented regularity and impunity of anti-lesbian rapes in
Nigeria.  The rapes of these four women were directly linked to an earlier
attack against another woman in the town of Eket in Akwa Ibom state, who
reportedly was also gang raped at gun point by the same men. She was
undergoing medical treatment at the feminist center when the rapists
attacked the center.
<br>
Since General Sani Abacha's military regime annulled national elections in
June 1993, repression has escalated to unprecedented levels, raising
serious human rights concerns.  These most recently include treason
charges
against Nobel Prize Laureate Wole Soyinka and 15 others on Wednesday March
12, 1997, the March 13, 1997 raid of the offices of the Institute of Human
Rights and Humanitarian Law (IHRHL), and the infamous execution of
environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues in November 1995.
These reports illustrate the political climate in which these rapes
occurred.
<br>
Not only lesbians have fallen prey to this rash of violent attacks against
women.  On November 9, 1996, the Saturday Punch, a local Nigerian daily,
reported the 10 man rape and consequent murder of a market business woman
in an Owena boundary market, which is the nerve center of trade between
Osun and Ondo states.
<br>
Nigerian feminists have contextualized the increasing incidence of rape as
manifestations of  male-domination and subsequent female exploitation.
According to a recently published concept paper by a group of Nigerian
feminist activists, "Christian and Islamic religions brought by the
colonialists introduced new roles [for women] that reinforced traditional
[patriarchal] provisions, and new areas not covered by tradition."   Add
to
this the current deteriorating political and economic climate, and endemic
violence against women is only intensified.
<br>
The human rights violations reported here can only be addressed by a
government which is accountable to its people.  International communities
in general need to pay closer and constant attention to events within
African states so as to increase our viability and effectiveness as
concerned agents.  The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission (IGLHRC) continues to monitor the situation closely, and shall
follow up with detailed directions on how to respond in support of
Nigerian
lesbian initiatives.

THE GUARDIAN, March 29 1997<br>
<b>KUWAIT SACKS PROFESSOR  WHO DARED TO SPEAK OF GAYS</b>
<br><br>
Alia Shoaib has split the establishment by claiming homosexuality thrives
under Islam, writes Kathy Evans in Kuwait City. A woman has been dismissed
from her professorial chair at Kuwait university for suggesting that
homosexuality exists in the emirate. Dr Alia Shoaib, aged 31, claimed that
lesbianism was rampant among students and that she had witnessed two women
making love in the university toilets. One of them was heavily veiled, a
manner of dress normally associated with militant Islam. The professor
made
the remarks in an informal conversation with a student who subsequently
published them in a local magazine. The magazine, al-Hadaf, is now being
sued for obscenity. In the Middle East, homosexuality truly is the love
that dare not speak its name. The issue of gay rights has never been
raised
and most gays are still very much in the closet. Many live in fear of
being
discovered, for in a number of states, such as Iran and Saudi
Arabia,homosexual acts between consenting adults are a capital offence.
<br><br>
Since her comments, Dr. Shoaib has faced an investigation by the
university authorities and hints, she claims, of her citizenship being
withdrawn.  Her books of short stories and poems, which cover a variety of
sexual themes, are also facing prosecution. Dr Faiza Khorafi, the female
president of Kuwait University, who was responsible for her dismissal,
claims that homosexuality does not exist in Kuwait. "Ours is a Muslim
society and homosexuality is against Islam," she says. Dr Shoaib maintains
that the segregation of men and women in Muslim societies has generated a
repressive sexual climate. "Sexuality is locked up and is therefore being
expressed in unorthodox forms," she said in an interview. "The gay
lifestyle in the West is much more healthy. Western gays are honest about
their sexuality."
<br><br>
Dr Shoaib read philosophy at Birmingham university.  In Gulf terms she
could be classified as the region's first radical feminist, arguing for
such feminist ideals as a woman having control of her own body and the
right to pursue her sexual identity and choose her husband.
Hercontroversial views have divided the establishment.  The
under-secretary of
the education ministry, Dr Rasha Sabah, describes as "a dinosaur
mentality"
the belief that homosexuality does not exist in Kuwait. Dr Shoaib's
dismissal has yet to be confirmed by the education minister. One leading
liberal member of parliament, Abdullah Nibarri, comments: "Homosexuality
is
not only prevalent in our society, it is part of our culture. Men used to
go to sea for long periods and homosexuality among men is not abhorrent,
particularly for those who play the role of men." In contrast, the
information minister, Sheikh Saoud al-Nasser al-Sabah, says the
professor's
comments have "defamed the university and its students". "We know there
are
gays in Kuwait, but we are not San Francisco. They are hidden and should
remain so," the sheikh says. University professors say the case has
implications for the freedom of speech of both teachers and students at
the
universtiy. One female professor was forced to submit to an investigation
recently after being accused by an Islamic militant student of teaching
the
theories of Darwin. "Ours is becoming a puritanical society, and Dr.
Alia's
case has made us all frightened," says one female professor who does not
want to be identified. Even so, homosexuality is a theme which is just
beginning to emerge in books and the media.  
<br><br>Another leading
Kuwaitinovelist, Leila Othman, is currently facing obscenity charges for
her book
The Departure. It contains a short story about two Kuwaiti girls having a
lesbian relationship, and another dealing with homosexuality among the
emirate's immigrant labourers. Labourers are not allowed to bring their
families with them, and are often housed in cramped conditions.
<br><br>
Dr Shoaib's novels and poems are facing similar problems in being
published. One book currently banned covers the issue of marital rape. A
Saudi satellite channel, ART, broadcast recently the first interviews
with gays, in which an Arab homosexual was allowed to speak of his sincere
love for another man.  But the programme was spliced with songs and
pictures of brides in wedding dresses.

<b>ARGENTINA </b> March
<br> LESBIAN, GAY, TRANVESTITE, TRANSEXUAL AND
BISEXUAL NATIONAL CONFERENCE.<br> 
Salta, Argentina - 28 y 29 de Marzo de 1997<br> <br> 
When last year at the I Conference, Salta was chosen as host for
the II, we all knew it was a challenge. And we were right. A few days
before our arrival, a local conservative newspaper wrote about the
perverts ready to invade the city, while pro-family and christian groups
threaten with a human chain to impede our entrance to the hotel.
In that climate, about 50 activists from Buenos Aires and Rosario
arrived in a very movilized town. Local media covered the conference
all the time; to our surprise, newspapers and TV were serious, res-
pectful and informative. The promoted human chain never materialized;
on the contrary, people everywhere showed us solidarity and affection.
As trans activist Lohanna Berkins said to a local media, Salta's socie-
ty proved to be a long way ahead of its leaders. Police participation
was reduced to following our bus wherever it went and being on duty
in front of the bar where workshops were held.Political pressures made the
University to back off at the last moment.<br> <br> 
leaving us without a place for workshops and plenaries. The Conferen-
ce was then held at a local gay bar, Nosotros. It was not at all the
most suitable place (several workshops had to be reformulated) but
everyone's good disposition soon made it seem fitted.
Overcoming their fears, local lesbians, gays and tranvestites attended
in growing numbers, and that was one of the Conference's main achie-
vements. By the end, they almost outnumbered those coming from o-
ther provinces.<br> <br> 
Workshops were suitable for all tastes. Young Gays and Lesbians Group
(Buenos Aires) invited us to a generational exchange, where the elders
told how our young days had been. Marcelo Ferreyra (CHA, Buenos Ai-
res) promoted the Argentinean gltt movement's history. Lohanna
Berkins and Paula Rodriguez (ALIT, Buenos Aires) used maks to con-
nect everyone with their "inner tranvestite". We, Escrita en el Cuerpo,
shared a warm and deep collective reflection on activists' private and
public lives, their conflicts and potentials. Nestor Talento (Lugar Gay,
Buenos Aires) analized gay couples; Cesar Cigliutti (CHA, Buenos
Aires) facilitated an analysis of new strategies to be implemented be-
fore the media, while Pedro Paradiso (Arco Iris, Rosario) made us
face AIDS and our excuses.<br> <br> 
For the first time, a workshop brought together lesbians, bi and trans
women; it was facilitated by Lesbianas a la Vista and its subject was
the diverse constructions of sexual identity. Two workshops awoke po-
werful and deep emotions in us all: 100 years of conscience (Diana Mi-
nes, Mujer y Mujer, Uruguay) - a collective dramatization stating with
the dawn of homosexual movements in Germany and ending with Sto-
newall and today's pride statement in each one of us- and Zapatos taco
aguja (Belen Correa, ATA, Buenos Aires) an impressing monologue on
daily violence forced upon tranvestites, with later debate.
Two "out of schedule" actions became an unforgettable experience for us
all, but mostly for locals. On Friday night, several of us went to
O'Clock,
the most elegant gay disco in town. The owner did not allow local
tranvesti-
tes to enter, while not applying the same rule to those from Buenos
Aires.The answer was a very noisy demostration outside the bar, inviting
the pa-
trons to join in -which they did. It all ended with Conference lesbians,
gays
and tranvestites at the disco's stage, using microphones to invite
everyone
to attend next day's workshops. On Saturday night, Salta witnessed for
the first time in its history a Pride Parade. We all marched embracing
each
other, preceded by the rainbow flag, first in silence but soon with chants
and
slogans. It was very moving to see local gays, lesbians and tranvestites
who just the day before spoke of their panic to be visible,  and now were
proudly
marching.<br> <br> 
Several important resolutions were agreed upon at this II Conference:<br> <br> 
* To organize a national campaign towards an Antidiscriminatory Law espe-
cifically mentioning sexual identity and orientation, coordinated by a
natio-
nal coalition of groups and individual (meetings will be held in Rosario

<b>UNITED STATES/MISSISSIPPI</b>,  February - Letter to newspaper.
"Battle for same-sex marriage has been fought and lost"
     Have the Hattiesburg American, the local television stations and
other
media outlets adopted the Camp Sister Spirit refugees as some type of
mascot,
or do you just find these social miscreants an interesting study in
deviant
social behavior?  These women have whined, fussed, cussed and cried before
our Legislature on behalf of all individuals of the same sex that want to
be
married.  Before going further, I do not even believe the word "married"
should be used in the context that they are advocating.
     Our governor has shot them down, as well as our Legislature.  We
should
all applaud them for their position and we can feel good in knowing that
our
elected representatives reflect the feelings of their constituents.
However,
I do not think the women of Camp Sister Spirit understand that their
battle
is over and they have lost.  Our state, thank God, will not condone this.
This leaves the inhabitants of the camp in Ovett no social battles to
fight,
even though by their actions they have admitted to breaking the sodomy
laws
of our state.  Thus, they should move on to other locales to plead their
case
and spew their venom.
     The citizens of Ovett will gladly buy their farm, their buildings and
the eye-sore of a tin wall they have constructed along the border of
theirproperty.  We will pay them a fair price and ensure them a profit.
We will
even throw in two one-way tickets to Hawaii.
     I hope they will consider this.  If they truly feel we are all
religious
fanatics, then perhaps they should also consider a non-Christian
atmosphere
in which to take up residence.

<b>THAILAND</b> - January  (Reuter) - A furor has broken out in
Thailand over a government ban on homosexuals becoming teachers.
         Homosexual and lesbian activists denounced the ban, which
starting in March will bar homosexuals from teacher training
colleges on the grounds that they do not make good role models.
         Education Minister Sukavit Rangsitphol said this week that
he would not bow to pressure by activists to reverse the ban.
         ``The ministry has not violated human rights. The ruling is
only aimed at banning people with improper personalities from
being models for youngsters,'' he added.
         Said the pro-lesbian group Hajaree: ``What kind of sexual
behavior people choose to follow is their personal affair and
has nothing to do with their brains. Banning homosexuals from
becoming teachers is discriminatory and violates basic human
rights.''
         But radio commentator and Sen. Amnaj Sornhimsart said: ``I
recognize that gays are geniuses in various arts and academic
fields. But we should have some measures to prevent youngsters

DENMARK</b> - January (Honolulu Star Bulletin)
<br>Laurence Vergez was a French exchange student in
Copenhagen when she met Mia Andersen 15 years ago.
Two years later they decided to live together, which would have been easy
if
they had been a heterosexual couple.
But as lesbians, they had no way to avoid the threat of deportation for
Vergez. "If we had been a straight couple, we would have just gone to the
Town Hall and got married," said Andersen, a book seller and minister with
the Metropolitan Community Church, which offers spiritual guidance for
homosexuals.
For the next six years, they lived in uncertainty. Vergez maintained a low
profile, but police continued to tell her she couldn't live in Denmark
with
the papers she had.
When they heard about the 1989 partnership law, they dashed to the Town
Hall
on a Saturday, joining three other same-sex couples in one ceremony.
"We got registered and then went to the police, thumbing our noses,"
Andersen said with a smile.
Andersen, 39, said her mother supports their union and likes to use it to
shock people: "She'll bring up marriage and say: 'Yes, my daughter is
married to a woman.'"
Vergez, 37, now teaches history, French and music in first to ninth
grades.
She said when students started asking about her private life, she
consulted
with a union representative, saying: "I'm gay and I don't intend to make
it
a secret."
The reaction has remained at "oh," with no homophobic backlash from
students
or parents, she said.
For the two, legal partnership was a practical solution to immigration
problems.
"But ultimately, the reason is one of love," Vergez said. "You don't take
this step until you plan to be in a committed relationship."

<b>RUSSIA</b> -January (Reuter) - Amazons, the mythical female warriors first
described by the ancient Greeks, may have actually once existed in Russia,
New Scientist magazine reported Thursday.
         Jeannine Davis-Kimball of the Center for the Study of Eurasian
Nomads in Berkeley, Calif., told New Scientist that 2,000-year-old burial
mounds excavated on the Russian steppes indicated that some of the women
buried in them were fighters.
         The grave mounds, left by nomadic tribes who roamed the steppes
of
central Asia from about 600 to 200 BC, are full of bronze arrowheads,
daggers and swords.
         Many have small handles, indicating they were used by the women
whose remains were also in the graves.
         ``They were probably made specifically for these women,''
Davis-Kimball told the magazine, saying she doubted the weapons were used
for hunting.
         Other archeological evidence indicated the Sauromatian and
Sarmatian nomadic tribes herded animals and did not hunt much.
         The mounds, found near the Russian town of Pokrovka, fit the
Greek
legend neatly, Davis-Kimball said. The historian Herodotus said he saw a
tribe of fierce female
warriors in his travels north of the Black Sea around 450 BC.
         Philip Kohl, an archeologist specializing in central Asian
cultures at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, agreed.
         When weapons turned up in men's graves it was assumed the men
were
warriors. He said the Russian find should be interpreted in the same
light.
         ``It does mean that women were fighting back then,'' he said. ``I
guess we've come full circle now, with women in our armed services.''

month after being beaten and threatened with death in Algeria.
        Faysal had been a political activist in Algeria, founding a group
to
battle the spread of AIDS and a second organization to promote human
rights.

Muslims
chased him and threatened him with death, prompting Faysal to flee Algeria

   established February 1995. The founding members of SAPHO elected a
   president and discussed the direction of the newly formed lesbian
   organization. Prior to the establishment of SAPHO there was no lesbian
   organization in Lithuania. Since there were no formally established or
   active lesbian organizations in Lithuania, the creator of LALGO (the
   Lithuanian Assoc. of Lesbian &amp; Gay Organization) did not include or
   take into consideration the needs of the lesbian community in
   Lithuania. Thus it is a misnomer to imply that lesbians are included
   within LALGO. Furthermore, LALGO was created primarily as a gay men's
   organization, which limited and minor emphasis given to the lesbian
   community.

<b>THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE </b> January 13
<br> 
Lesbians, Gays Seek Asylum From Persecution Abroad David Tuller,
Chronicle Staff Writer
<br> <br>In her native
Cameroon, Cecile says she was arrested twice, raped by prison guards and
cut with a razor by a traditional
healer seeking to release the ``demons'' possessing her. The reason? She
is a lesbian. Now Cecile, a
29-year-old who lives in Oakland and works as a cashier at a San Francisco
restaurant, is seeking political
asylum in the United States. ``I'm already labeled there as a lesbian, so
I'm very scared to go back without the
protection of the U.S.,'' she says. Even as the federal and state
governments take steps to restrict immigration
and halt the flow of foreigners arriving here illegally, a growing number
of gays and lesbians are applying for
-- and winning -- political asylum because of persecution based on their
sexual orientation. In the past two
years, more than 60 people -- including a few bisexuals and transgendered
people as well as gays and lesbians
-- have proven to the satisfaction of immigration officials and judges
that they have a ``well-founded fear of
persecution'' in their homelands. The applicants have come from all
corners of the globe, including the former
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Central and South America and Southeast
Asia. Many who favor stricter
immigration controls are disturbed by the trend, which they say represents
an abuse of the asylum system. Yet
gay and lesbian activists counter that the development reflects growing
awareness that in many countries gays
are harassed, beaten up, imprisoned and even executed and that such
treatment clearly constitutes persecution
under the terms of asylum law. ``This is a fair and appropriate
application of the law, not a great expansion of
it,'' said Sydney Levy, asylum project coordinator of the International
Gay and Lesbian Human Rights
Commission. The San Francisco group has just published, along with the
Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a resource guide for lawyers and others involved in such
asylum cases. 
<br><br>
The
movement for gay political asylum gained momentum in 1994, when Attorney
General Janet Reno issued a
memo declaring that the Immigration and Naturalization Service and
immigration judges should regard an
earlier gay asylum case as precedent. In effect, Reno's decision made it
easier for gay asylum-seekers and their
attorneys to win their cases by acknowledging that gays and lesbians were
members of a recognized ``social
group'' that might be persecuted by foreign governments. But opponents of
liberal immigration policies say
that granting asylum to gays and lesbians -- as well as to women fleeing
clitoral circumcision in Africa or
Islamic repression in the Middle East -- will encourage an overwhelming
flood of asylum-seekers. ``Our
concern is that blowing these categories wide open will invite a flood of
claims and create a backdoor
immigration program,'' said Dan Stein, executive director of the
Federation for American Immigration Reform
in Washington, D.C. ``The fact that there is gay- bashing (in another
country) doesn't mean that every gay
person there should qualify for asylum in this country,'' said Stein.
``That's asking our asylum system to solve
a problem that's far beyond its capacity. Plus, there's a fraud problem.
There are hundreds of millions of
people who want to move here, so you don't want to set up statutory
standards that are easily gimmicked
through lack of proof.'' 
<br><br>
 Not all the recent cases have
been successful. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently heard the appeal of a
Russian lesbian whose claim for asylum
was rejected by the INS and the Board of Immigration Appeals. The woman,
who works for a Bay Area travel
agency, said she had been arrested many times and forced to undergo
psychiatric treatment because of her
lesbianism. The INS, in ruling against her, argued that Russia no longer
persecuted gays and lesbians and that
the intent of forced psychiatric treatment was not to harm the individual.
The Ninth Circuit is expected to decide
the case sometime later this year. Under the law, asylum is available to
those who can prove that they face
persecution or have ``a well-founded fear of persecution'' on account of
race, religion, nationality, membership
in a particular social group, or political views. While federal law
imposes quotas on the number of people
granted refugee status, there are no limits to the number of those
eligible for asylum. The only catch is that they
can apply only once they are already in the United States. CHANGE IN LAW
Under a recent change in
immigration law, anyone who wants to seek asylum in the future will have
to file a claim within a year of
arrival. Those who believe they have a valid asylum claim and are already
living in the United States must apply
by April 1. Immigration officials and judges recognize that it is often
difficult to prove past persecution and
frequently base their decisions on the claimant's own statements and on
information about conditions for
homosexuals in the country of origin. And the stories of many of the
applicants make for compelling -- and
horrifying -- reading. In her affidavit, Cecile recounts being arrested
while studying law at the university.
``That night, three officers came to my cell and tied a dirty rag across
my mouth,'' she says in the affidavit.
``Two held me and tore off my clothes. The officers raped me. I fainted as
the second officer raped me. I woke
up, and there was blood and male fluids all over me. . . . For the next
two days, the police only gave me water
and no food.'' After Cecile's release, she says, her family forced her to
see a traditional healer, who attempted
to ``cure'' her of her sexual attraction to women. Finally, she managed to
come to the United States, on a
business visa, and applied for asylum. Her case is pending. response to
anti-lesbian and gay statements in
Namibia. The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality in South
Africa responds to the anti-lesbian and
gay statements of President Sam Nujoma and the SWAPO Party of Namibia as
follows: The Coalition is
seriously concerned about these developments in a neighbouring state. We
strongly support the lesbian and gay
community of Namibia against arbitrary attack and prejudice. It is tragic
that lesbian and gay Namibians have
been singled out for attack in this way by their President and majority
party. 
<br><br>
We condemn SWAPO's call for
the struggle to continue by uprooting homosexuality from Namibian
society'. This is a misguided call for
action, particularly from a liberation movement of the stature of SWAPO
which has always fought for equality
and justice for all. More serious challenges face the Namibian people
under President Nujoma, such as
alleviating poverty and redressing the inequities of the past. An
inclusive human rights culture is required to
prevent any repeat of this history of discrimination. President Nujoma's
statements concerning homosexuality
are extremely disappointing from a liberation movement leader and not
appropriate to a head of state.
Allegations that homosexuality is foreign to Africa are factually
incorrect and inflammatory. President
Mugabe's similar anti lesbian and gay rhetoric drew international
disapproval. Southern Africa cannot afford
new campaigns of oppression and discrimination against any group. South
Africa's constitutional guarantee of
lesbian and gay equality is a beacon of hope to lesbian and gay Africans.
The Namibian Constitution guarantees
freedom of association and expression and equality on the basis of sex
(international legal precedent includes
sexual orientation within the definition of ïsexÍ). Namibia is also
signatory to the Convention on the
Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination. It is discrimination that is
un-African and not homosexuality. The
Coalition calls on all people committed to promoting human rights to
condemn homophobia and all forms of
discrimination in the strongest terms. END.

<h3>Lesbian Activism:</h3>
<p>
"We are always in a political movement, but not always in a political
movement phase of a political culture" (Sarah Hoagland, 1996).
<p>
<h3> Lesbianism as resistance:</h3>
<p>
"For a woman to be a lesbian in a male-supremacist, capitalist,
misogynist, racist, homophobic, imperialist culture, such as that of North
America, is an act of resistance" (Cheryl Clarke, 1981)
<p>
<h3> Lesbian Chic:</h3>
<p>
"The recent flurry of articles on hip lesbians...isn't about
documentation...it's about creation: building a better lesbian, one
palatable enough for mainstream consumption...to
gain legitimacy and be taken seriously in the 1990s, cultures outside the 
mainstream must prove they are free of the disruptive nature and
threatening intent of activisms past..." (Judith Schwartz, quoted in
Cragin, 1997)
<p>
<h3>Lesbian Feminism:</h3>
<p>
"Lesbian feminism proceeds from an analysis of gender interests which
situates lesbians primarily as women rather than homosexuals, thus
distinguishing it from gay theory which proceeds from an analysis of
sexual
identity and interests (a difference noted by Eve Sedwick). [Lesbian
feminism] also bases itself in the primacy of identity, distinguishing it
further from queer theory which lays primary emphasis on actions and
performance." (Bonnie Zimmerman, 1996).
<p>
<h3>Lesbian Feminists</h3> <p>
"Lesbians of the 70s, can be divided into lesbian feminists and feminist
lesbians. The
former usually 'came out' after being exposed to feminism and had a
history of heterosexuality. The latter were usually lifelong or long-time
lesbians with little or no heterosexual history, who integrated feminism
into their identity. These differing paths to lesbianism were an important
factor behind the ideological contests and the lesbian civil wars of the
70s" (Y. Retter, 1998). <p>
"Lesbian feminists are the bad girls who fail to love the male frame of
mind that currently dominates gay and lesbian studies" (Sheila Jeffreys,
1994).
<p>
<h3> Lesbian History</h3>
<p>
"As a woman, as a lesbian, as a Jew, much of what I call history, others
will not. But answering that challenge of exclusion is the work of a
lifetime" (Joan Nestle, 1987).
<p>
"Lesbian history is under-researched and undertheorized"
(Martha Vicinus, 1994).
<p>
<h3>Lesbian Invisibility:</h3>
<p>
"Between the time of Sappho and the birth of Natalie Clifford Barney
(between ca 613 bc and 1876 ad) lies a 'lesbian silence' of
twenty-four centuries" (Bertha Harris In Our Right To Love, 1978). 
<p>
"Without a visual identity, we have no community, no support network, no
movement. Making ourselves visible is a political act, making ourselves
visible is a continual process." (Joan E. Biren in Visual Communication,
1983).
<p>
<h3>Lesbian Persistence:</h3>
<p>
"Lesbian supression is so strong that if it weren't inherent in some, it
would have dissappeared [!]" (Marilyn Frye, 1996).
<p>
* Lesbian separatism: 
<p>
"Separatism is an exhausting act of faith and because of insistent
pressure 
on [one] to repent, it requires almost daily reaffirmation" (Janet Dixon
in Hemmings and Cant, 1988).
<p>
<h3>Lesbian intensity:</h3>
<p>
" One year as a lesbian is like three years in the het world"
(Leslie Rand, recovering heterosexual, 1996).
<p>
<h3>Cultural Feminism/Lesbianism:</h3>
<p>
"Cultural feminism represents a retreat from the difficulties of
political struggle into the self-validation that community-building
offers. It further substitutes the fantasy of a united sisterhood for
political theory" (Alice Echols, quoted in Howard, 1997).
<p>
<h3>Queer Theory and Politics:</h3>
<p>
"The wholesale embracing of theatrical metaphor [in queer theory] denies
the historicity of all lesbian roles, and their specific meanings at
different historical times" (Martha Vicinus, 1994)
<p>

<b> Related Thoughts </b>
<p>
<h3>Intersections of Oppression:</h3>
<p>
"The concept of the simultaneity of oppression 
is still the crux of a Black feminist understanding of political
reality...and is one of the most significant ideological contributions of
Black feminist thought" (Barbara Smith, 1983, xxxii).
<p>
"The modifier 'multiple' refers not only to several, simultaneous
oppressions, but to the multiplicative relationships among them as
well" (Deborah King, 1988). 
<p>
<h3>About Lesbians:</h3>
<p>
"In Anglo-Saxon Countries it seems...that female homosexuality means
rather more than Sapphic lyricism, since it somehow acts as a stimulus to
the social and political organization of women..."
(Carl Jung in Civilization in Transition, 1922).
<p>
<h3>By lesbians about women:</h3>
<p>
"As a writer, I am not defferential. Writing without apology and without
trivializing the writing because one is a woman is a major contribution"
(Andrea Dworkin, in Jenefsky, Without Apology, 1998)
<p>
<h3>About resistant women:</h3>
<p>

           "I myself have never been able to find out precisely what
feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist
                           whenever I express sentiments that
differentiate me from a doormat..." 

                                                (Rebecca West)

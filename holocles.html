* There are few resources dealing with the fate of lesbians under the
  Nazis. This is largely due to the fact that they were classed generally
with
  'anti-socials' to obliterate the fact of their actual existence, which
effectively
  obliterates them from history. Days of Masquerade: Life Stories of
Lesbians during
  the Third Reich by Claudia Schoppman (translated by Allison Brown) and
The
  Hidden Holocaust: Gay and Lesbian Persecution in Germany 1933-45, edited
by
  Gunter Grau and Claudia Schoppmann are the only books I am aware of that
deal
  with the Nazi treatment of lesbians.[Source:

                   Fund for lesbian survivors of the
                   Holocaust and Shoa.
                   In February 1996 a fund was created by the Swiss
Government in order to
                   compensate needy survivors of the Holocaust and Shoa.
Victims who
                   were persecuted by the Nazis as a result of their
sexual orientation are
                   entitled to receive compensation through this fund. To
this end, both the
                   Lesbian Organisation of Switzerland (LOS) and Pink
Cross (Gay men)
                   have a representative on the Advisory Committe. The
petitions of two gay
                   survivors have already been approved.
                   The Lesbian Organisation of Switzerland (LOS) wishes to
make the
                   existence of the fund known and to encourage needy
lesbian survivors of
                   the Nazi persecution to take up contact with them.

* "In only a few cases can it be demonstrated that women were tried on the
pretext of other offenses but in reality because of their homosexuality.
In one
documented instance female homosexuality was cited by the administration
of
the Ravensbruck concentration camp as the grounds of detention. Thus, on
30
November 140 the transportation list for this women's camp names the day's
eleventh 'admission' as the non-Jewish Elli S., exactly 26 years of age.
The
term 'lesbian' actually appears in the entry as the reason for detention.
Elli S.
was apparently put among the political prisoners, but nothing further is
known
of her fate.

Love Story </b> Berlin 1943 Fischer, Erica
                (translated from the German by Edna McCown) English
translation 1994, HarperCollins Publishers
                ISBN 0-06-018350-0 
                (From the dust cover) 
                       Out of the vacuum created by history's scant
attention to Nazi persecution of
                       homosexuals comes a unique and maddeningly tragic
story of love between two
                       women of startling contrast. Aimee &amp; Jaguar is the
first book of its kind: it tells
                       through Rashomon-like firsthand accounts, of the
horrors - and the joys - shared
                       by Felice Schragenheim, who did not survive the war
- and Elisabeth Wust, who
                       lived to finally tell their story after more than
fifty years of silence. Aimee &amp; Jaguar
                       is set against a compelling historical backdrop of
increasing pressure placed on
                       Jews, homosexuals, and non-Aryans in Nazi Germany
beginning in the early
                       1930's. 
                       In 1943, as Allied bombs rained down on her home
city of Berlin, Elisabeth Wust,
                       Gentile mother of four and wife of a Nazi officer
stationed at the front, met Felice
                       Schragenheim in a Berlin coffee shop. And what
began as a polite, hesitant curiosity
                       about each other sooin developed into a passionate
love that would last a lifetime.
                       What Elisabeth would not know during the early part
of their relationship was that
                       Felice was a submarine -- a Jew living underground.
Upon learning the truth
                       behind the mystery surrounding Felice's identity,
Elisabeth was forced to confront
                       and come to terms with her own ingrained
anti-Semitism. 
                       The two women lived together in Elisabeth's home in
what they believed was a
                       blissful safe haven in a world gone awry.
Ultimately Felice was revealed to the
                       Gestapo and deported to the Czecho- slovakian
ghetto of Thereseinstadt. Devastated
                       yet determined, Elisabeth - putting her own life in
danger - tried in vain to join Felice
                       in the ghetto, and it was only several years after
the war's end that she learned of
                       Felice's fate: she had been sent to Bergen-Belsen.
where she died in 1945. 
                Felice, of course, was imprisoned and died not because she
was a Lesbian, but because she was a
                Jew. In general, Lesbians do not appear to have fared as
badly as did homosexual males. From The
                Other Victims: First Person Stories of Non-Jews Persecuted
by the Nazis, 
                Ina R. Friedman, 1990, Part I, Chapter 2 "The Pink
Triangle," p. 28: 
                       While some lesbians were sent to concentration
camps, there were no laws against
                       lesbianism. The Nazis could not believe that German
women would be interested in
                       anything other than the  production of children.

* Love Story [60 minutes-1997] Catrine Clay In 1942 Berlin, Lilly Wurst
was a model Aryan hausfrau with a picture of the Fuhrer on the
wall, a husband in the army, and a German motherhood medal for bearing
four sons. With this distinction came mother's helper Ulla
Schaaf, who unbeknownst to Lilly was deeply involved with the Jewish
underground. When Lilly boasted that she could "smell a Jew",
Ulla tested her by introducing her to Felice Schraderheim, a 20 year old
Jewish woman living in hiding. The result of that meeting is an
unusual love story whose arc is followed through recollections, documents,
and archival footage in this beautifully made documentary. As
Ulla Schaaf and others in the Jewish underground describe living in
constant fear of denunciation, they recall how Felice risked her life to
smuggle false papers. In intimate interviews, Lilly tells how their
relationship deepened until Felice revealed to her the secret of her
Judaism.
Sharing a home, wedding vows, and the care of Lilly's children, in 1944
Felice chose to stay in Berlin with Lilly rather than flee to neutral
Switzerland. Later that year she was arrested by the Gestapo , never to
return. Now 82, Lilly shares her remaining photos and love letters to
recall the great love of her life. As survivors from the underground
recall acts of everyday courage, Love Story powerfully depicts ordinary
people's resistance to injustice. Skillful, haunting, and elegiac, Love
Story is a potent meditation on the healing and transformative power of
love and compassion in the face of adversity. "A stunningly evocative
story of forbidden love in Nazi Germany."-The New York Lesbian
and Gay Film Festival. "A powerful reminder both of the horrific wounds
left by the Nazi regime, and the enduring nature of love."-The
Daily Mail [Source: Northern Arizona University web site].

Excerpt from article by Elman:
BLACK TRIANGLES: LESBIANISM OBSCURED
<p>
"The fact that the pink triangle is regarded as a symbol of gay and
lesbian liberation is disturbing because pink
triangles were exclusively worn by those men the Nazis had identified as
gay.  By contrast, "The average
lesbian enjoyed a kind of legal immunity" (Plant, 1986, p. 27). This was
not the result of a greater acceptance
of lesbianism. Rather, love between women was so intolerable that lesbian
existence had been vociferously
denied. 
<p>Later, in 1910, measures to criminalize lesbians were considered
but then promptly abandoned.
Feminist opposition proved politically effective (Faderman &amp; Eriksson,
1990, p. xv; Steakley, 1975, p. 42).
Consequently, paragraph 175 never extended to lesbians. Yet, as we
will note below, male-dominated
society would find "more suitable ways to suppress any kind of female
independence" (Fernbach, 1980, p. 10
[my emphasis]).  
<p>
The most effective way to render lesbians powerless was to sever their
connection(s) to other women. With the
rise of Nazism, lesbian meeting places and private homes were raided and
their visibility was concealed
(Faderman &amp; Eriksson, 1990, p. xx). (10) "Lesbians," writes Irene Reti,
"were among those women
imprisoned as asocials considered a threat to German society before 1939"
(1993, p. 95).  All asocials
were identified through black down-turned triangles. These detainees "were
considered stupid, unable to
communicate, lacking the courage to stand up for a brother [sic]" (Plant,
1986, p. 160). The SS "despised"
them because "the color of their triangles was an insult to their own
black uniforms" (Plant, 1986, p. 160). 
<p>
It is politically significant that the asocial category was not
exclusively lesbian; it was a diverse grouping that
included prostitutes, vagrants, murderers, thieves, and those who violated
laws prohibiting sexual intercourse
between Aryans and Jews. Precisely because the asocial group was so
heterogeneous, lesbians were not as
readily identifiable as were gay men whose pink marking exclusively
signified their homosexuality.
Universalizing the pink triangle today renders lesbians almost as
invisible as the black triangles did in the past.
Failure to appreciate this obscures some vital aspects of fascist history. 
...
Even within the newly established Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington,
D.C. one is unable to find any
accurate information on lesbians."

* Playing for Time (New
York, N.Y.: Athenaeum,1977):
"              Memoirs of a French Jewish survivor of the camps. Includes
fairly extensive
              portrayals of lesbian -- and butch/femme -- sociability
among women interned as
              "asocials" at Auschwitz, presented in an ambivalent if not
openly derogatory
              tone. 
<p>
Fenelon notes that asocials' were marked with a
black
triangle and
              describes an evening of entertainment in the asocials'
barracks as the 'Black
              Triangles' Ball'. 
<p>This book is probably a key source of the
erroneous notion that
              the Nazis used a black triangle to mark lesbians in the
camps in a manner
              equivalent to the pink triangle used for homosexual men."

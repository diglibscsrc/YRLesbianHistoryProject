<p>
* MALCS MEETING
<br/>
The MALCS summer institute is slated to be held Wednesday, July 30th
through
August 3rd, 1997 on the
C.U. Boulder campus. This years theme is Solidaridad: Collaborating Across
Identities, Communities &amp; Boundaries.
<p>
        For those of you who are unfamiliar with the organization, Mujeres
Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS) is an organization of Chicanas/
Latinas and Native American women working in academia and in community
settings with a common goal: to work toward the support, education and
dissemination of Chicana/ Latina and Native American womens issues.
 Chicanas/Latinas and Native American women from a variety of
institutions gather at this yearly Summer Institute to network, share
information, offer support and re-energize. The MALCS Summer Institute is
one of the few places Chicanas/Latinas and Native American women can come
together without the influence of male and/or Euro-American consciousness
or opinion.
<p>
     While some charge that this is separatist, the MALCS reply is
not one of apology. This is our space. The dynamics of this Chicana/Latina
and Native American woman space is worth guarding, even in the face of
criticism from those we respect and work with in our home institutions. If
you have any questions and/or need further please contact:

*  The 2nd Hijas del Quinto Sol conference will focus on Latina writing
that expresses the pluralistic cultural backgrounds falling under the
rubric
of "Latina."  Conference will explore
 what it means to be a latina, especially a Latina writer, in the US
today.

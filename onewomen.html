<h3>THE WOMEN OF ONE</h3>
<p>
by Jim Kepner
<p>	Too many writers have claimed that, before the Daughters of 
Bilitis started (San Francisco 1955) the homophile movement, as it was 
then known, was almost entirely white-male, and the rare women 
participants were expected to make coffee or keep minutes. Of course a 
few male chauvinists in the Mattachine Society did suggest such duties, 
"now that we have some girls here," but some Mattachine women, from early 
1953 on, played pivotal roles (the most outstanding being Marilyn 
"Boopsie" Reiger, who took a leading concervative role in the pivotal 
1953 Conventions, as well as the woman who headed the Oakland chapter, 
and attorney Pearl Hart, a founder and long-time leader of Chicago 
Mattachine.) 
    </p>
<p>    
	From 1954 to 1960, women took leading roles in ONE Incorporated 
and ONE Magazine. [The terms girls or gals and boys were used about as 
often by women then as by men, and were not considered derogatory, though 
we already avoided such terms when referring to Blacks.]
</p>
<p>   
	Betty Perdue, aka Geraldine Jackson, (who took this writer to his 
first Mattachine meeting in late 1952) did a poem, Proud &amp; Unashamed for 
ONE's first issue, Jan 1953, and helped use a paper cutter to 
disastrously trim issue #2 -- produced in the office of editor Dale 
Jennings' sister Elaine. Betty, whom I'd first met in 1947, regularly 
complained that my news column Tangents ran too many unhappy stories -- 
raids, murders, arrests, blackmail, etc -- "why can't you give us more 
happy news?" Happy news was hard to find in those days, and the news I 
gleaned from the non-gay press was 5 to 1 more likely to be about gay men 
than women. Betty later started a shortlived Homosexuals Anonymous group 
(Thelma and Flo, mentioned below, were also involved somewhat in this.) 
She attended many ONE affairs, usually carrying several shopping 
bags, and was often introduced as a pioneer, until her death during the 
1987 earthquake.
</p>
<p>  
February 1954 was ONE's first special issue, "The Feminine Viewpoint." A 
section by that name occupied about a third of each issue for several 
years. Corky and John had joined the active staff a few months earlier. 
Editor-in-Chief (and Board President) was Ann Carrl Reid (Corky.) Art 
Editor, elfin Joan Corbin (aka Eve Elloree)'s delicate, clever sketches 
set the magazine's tone. They'd grown up together in Ann Arbor, MI, and 
picked up "Lisa Ben's" pioneer lesbian publication, Vice-Versa (1947-48, 
limited to 15 or 20 carbon copies), some items from which were reprinted 
in that Feb 53 issue. Tiny, hard-driving Corky was a bread-winning butch 
who wanted her femme at home and limited to wifely concerns. Joan, one of 
the most personable and talented people I've ever worked with, eventually 
grew restive, spending more time working at ONE's office -- by then 
across the hall from Elaine Jennings's quarters, and by 1957, a game of 
musical chairs began.
</p>
<p>   
	About the time Barbara Gittings visited us in 1957, Joan had 
moved in with Stella Rush, who, writing as Sten Russell, did verse and 
excellent reporting for ONE and for The Ladder, often submitting the same 
articles or poems to both. Corky partnered with Vicki, who wrote chunks 
of "The Feminine Viewpoint" under such pennames as Gabrielle Ganelle. 
Corky never raised the sort of issues later associated with the new 
feminism after 1969, though she became restive with Dorr Legg's 
inflexibility, and it became evident to me during 1955 that women on the 
editorial board judged stories and poems in a different manner than men 
-- more feeling, less happening, but she was adamantly unwilling to admit 
that homophile women's and men's interests and goals sometimes diverged, 
was insulted by the suggestion that we start a separate women's magazine, 
and in serious ill-health, eventually resigned and returned to the 
midwest, visiting ONE's office once in recent years. Joan, who continued 
occasional work with ONE and later with Tangents magazine, joined with 
fellow artist Wilna Onthank, aka Willi or Dawn Fredericks, a victim of 
Catholic guilt (her gay brother committed suicide &amp; she was always 
tempted by that). Willi did a few ONE covers plus layout and artwork for 
my baby, ONE Institute Quarterly of Homophile Studies. I got crushes, 
emotional if not exactly sexual, on Joan, and more so on melancholy 
Willie with whom I often shared dinner. Then Joan bounced to handsome 
horsewoman Gingere Blakeley, and drifted away from us, moving out to the 
canyons north of L.A.. 
</p>
<p>  
	Other women on ONE's editorial board included jolly, plump Nancy, 
aka Alison Hunter, (who brought along her collection of hot sauces to 
dump into a pot of chili I'd made -- I like it less spicy). Our expanding 
social circle included Irene Weiss, a gamin crewcut blond (very rare 
then) who later started Califia Community, a local feminist project, and 
a striking pair of small, very formal metaphysical women decked out in 
gold braid and clinking bangles, and always seeming to stand or sit 
almost arm-in-arm. They attended most ONE social and educational 
functions, and sometimes spoke up on issues of metaphysical or aesthetic 
concern.
</p>
<p>   
	Stella (who had first visited the If Club on Vermont in rough 
clothes from her job with the L.A. County Engineers, then committed the 
unpardonable ki-ki sin of coming next night in femme clothing) soon found 
her psychic twin in Helen Sandoz or Sandy, the forgotten first president 
of the Daughters of Bilitis, who with other gays I knew had produced a 
small civic booster magazine in Portland. Sandy also helped encourage 
fellow Sears employee Troy Perry in 1968 to start a church to minister to 
gays. Rail-thin Stella, a gun collector, and Sandy both seemed butch to 
me, but called themselves "kiki," saying they'd found an equal 
relationship ("We share things. Sometimes I need a shoulder to cry on, 
and when she needs one, my shoulder's there.") ONE Trustees until mid 
1960, they later worked in the Council on Religion and the Homophile, and 
in Prosperos, a metaphysical group long allied with our movement. Harry 
Hay in the late 1960s considered them members of his Circle of Loving 
Companions. They edited The Ladder in 1967, and were the first in our 
circle to begin to talk like post-69 feminists. I visited them once when 
they moved to Costa Mesa, and last saw Stella (Sandy having died) at 
Orange County's first gay festival. She was invited to receive a 
Pioneer's Award at the 1995 Queer Frontiers Conference at USC, but 
objected, as many older activists did, to the term Queer. We have since 
been in communication by phone. 
</p>
<p>
	ONE and Mattachine were especially close to UCLA's dynamic and 
warm research psychologist Dr. Evelyn Hooker [not lesbian, and rather 
edgy about women getting too close to her, though until she became older, 
she was a formidable, masculine appearing woman] subject of the recent 
film documentary Changing Minds, whose research shattered many false 
assumptions the shrinks had made about homosexuals [she'd made her mark 
in a man's world, and loudly objected later to feminist inspired 
terminology, insisting on being called Chairman of the Presidential 
Committee on Homosexuality rather than chaairperson, whom she said was 
someone assigned to arrange chairs on stage] -- and also to the ebullient 
Dr. Blanche Baker, a grandmotherly state surgeon turned psychiatrist, who 
electrified our first Midwinter Institute in January 1955. After calling 
most gays wonderful, well adjusted, often highly talented people, she 
stopped and laughed: "I'm not used to saying this to people who already 
agree with me,"  so she shook us up by talking about reincarnation (the 
report that Bridey Murphy had, under hypnosis, recalled many details of a 
life in Ireland two centuries earlier), insisting she'd been a gay man in 
most of her earlier lives. Her Toward Understanding, for ONE, was the 
first advice column in an American gay publication. Then-prominent 
cure-peddler, the strident Dr. Albert Ellis, bitterly attacked her for 
saying that gays weren't necessarily neurotic. [He also clashed bitterly 
with Dr. Hooker.]
</p>
<p>   
Many women around the country wrote to and for ONE Magazine, including 
Jeannette Foster [author of the pioneering book, Sex Variant Women in 
Literature, Marlin Prentiss, Jody Shotwell, Carle, Lorna Strayer, and 
Barbara Grier, founder and proprietor of Naiad Press. We rarely 
questioned the idea that gay men and women were similarly victims of 
social prejudice and discrimination, but we found that most of our male 
readers wanted more sex [which we couldn't then give them], and most of 
our female readers wanted more sentiment. Both male and female readers 
often complained about the amount of space given to the other in the thin 
magazine. Betty Perdue wasn't the only one to complain that gay men had 
their minds in tea-rooms, though [unlike other women in our circle] Betty 
admitted having had sex in tea-rooms and bushes. Tall, dynamic Venice V. 
joined us around 1957, but her forceful ideas on promotion clashed with a 
leading male staffer.  I recall her noisily under the table from which I 
conducted parts of ONE Institute of Homophile Studies' first "Homosexuals 
in World History" course. Sanding and shellacking the table, she threw in 
many sharp comments, as Stella and Sandy also did.
</p>
<p>   
	By 1958, the Daughters of Bilitis organized an off-and-on Los 
Angeles chapter [Sandy was generally a drag, meeting each new suggestion 
with a nasal "We tried that, and it didn't work"], and while ONE and the 
DOB's national office were friendly, the local DOB chapter drew off 
recruits who might earlier have come to ONE. Turnover and a new awareness 
of male chauvenism reduced ONE's feminine viewpoint.  Coralee Webb, our 
first Black woman, came in the mid-sixties, as did Flo Fleischman and 
Jo-Ann Bruno, and my neighbor, Thelma Varga, who moved from ONE's drama 
group, ca. 1967, to later SPREE plays during the 1970s. [Flo, who founded 
DOB-Long Beach, attended the August 1966 North American Conference in San 
Francisco, was active with the Southern California Council on Religion 
and the Homophile, became an MCC minister, later leading an independent 
church, and is now a member of the ONE Institute/IGLA board. Jo-Anne was 
one of the local organizers of the 1979 March on Washington and the Jan 
1980 March on Sacramento.] But as vigorous new feminists critiqued 
male-dominance and sexism, women became scarce in mixed groups other than 
Metropolitan Community Church and the post-Stonewall parade committees, 
where they played a heavy role. 
</p>
<p>  
	At the five North American Conferences of Homophile 
Organizations, 1966-1970, most of the women participants were from the 
Daughters of Bilitis, who by then had chapters in several cities, in the 
Prosperos, which was later ousted as being a metaphysical rather than an 
explicitly homophile organization, and one waspish hetero woman from 
Mattachine Society of New York --who drew the ire of most of the risisng 
tide of radicals, male and female, at the end of this period. At the 
final NACHO conference, a group of militant feminists, led by Phyllis 
Lyon, took over the podium briefly, told the men to fuck off, and walked 
out. That conference soon disintegrated, attacked by an invasion of 
street gays, engineered by Morris Kight, and led by Cherie Morage from 
Los Angeles, and the male-feminist Bishop Mikhail Itkin.
</p>
<p>   
	ONE still drew occasional women, with shortlived women's 
committees appearing briefly in the 1970s, and we hope that the new ONE 
Institute/IGLA merger will improve its co-gender participation.

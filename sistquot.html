<p>"Sisterhood Bookstore means a tremendous amount to me.
         Many times, it has kept me going!! Seemingly an oasis, a
         sanctuary in a typical patriarchal US city. The hours and
         hours I have spent at Sisterhood could add up! The books of
         Sisterhood have opened worlds to me! I have grown and become
         a critically thinking feminist. (In the last 2 years I
         completed a MA in multi-cultural psychology.) I especially
         appreciate the Wicca Goddess Spirituality books which are
         finally becoming written and available. I hope to write a
         book soon and have it in Sisterhood!!" --<i>Lisa Kohane, Los
         Angeles</i></p>

<p>"Like finding an oasis in the desert. I was recently
         'out' in L.A. and basically pretty lost. I had never been in
         a bookstore like it before (this was 1982) and I haven't
         found another yet with it's ambiance and/or selection of
         books. I was so impressed with the atmosphere, I knew it was
         a place I wanted to be a part of, as it's been a part of
         me."--<i>Rose Glen, Los Angeles</i></p>

<p>"You anchored our exciting new movement--to a reader like
         me, the existence of a bookstore for and about us made our
         revolution real, visible, permanent. In many ways, you made
         a home for us--and you have never stopped. The parking
         problem and now the big chain bookstore have created
         terrible difficulties for you and us, but thank goodness
         you're hanging in there. You matter."--<i>Harriet Perl, Los
         Angeles</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"In the 16 years since moving to L.A. from back East,
         Sisterhood has been an anchor for me in a very personal way.
         The sweet scent of incense and ink, the sight of all those
         books celebrating women, even the creak of the wood floor
         under the carpet signal safety and nurturing of my lesbian
         soul. I shall not forget my first entry into Sisterhood
         while struggling to come out to myself and the world. The
         'vibe' there is so positive, it always feels like the
         pressure of society is off me as I browse through your
         wonderful selection of books, music, videos and community
         notices. I am a frequent visitor. Thank you for being
         there."--<i>Leslie Rabbitt, Los Angeles</i></p>

<p>"I especially treasure Sisterhood for the availability of
         lesbian periodicals, which are so essential to lesbian
         literature, thought and culture. With print runs of only a
         couple thousand, and all volunteer groups editing and
         publishing them, many journals, newsletters, zines, etc.,
         would never reach their audience without Sisterhood. Also,
         providing a venue for authors to read to and interact with
         readers is invigorating to the creative process."--<i>Tracy
         Moore, Los Angeles</i></p>

<p>"In this age of national chains dominating the retail
         book business, it is indeed a cause for celebration that
         this small women-centered bookstore not only has survived
         for twenty-five years, but that it continues in 1997, when
         it seems there's a Barnes and Noble on every other corner,
         to offer an alternative space to diverse communities of
         readers whose interests are not always represented in the
         context of corporate scale booksellers. I salute Sisterhood
         Bookstore. I commend its patrons for keeping this wonderful
         enterprise alive for a quarter of a century."--<i>Angela
         Davis</i></p>

<p>"I recently moved to L.A. Sisterhood provided a warm,
         friendly and intelligent resource for the local women's
         community. It is far more than a bookstore. Thanks!"--
         <i>Anonymous response, West Los Angeles</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I've never actually been to the store, but from the very
         first time I ordered books online, everyone was incredibly
         friendly and helpful. I was so glad to find a bookstore that
         carried children's books that would actually encourage my
         daughter to read. I was beginning to think I was the only
         person on earth that wanted to raise a strong,
         self-confident daughter. Everyone at your store has been
         very accommodating and went way out of their way to get me
         the books I wanted. Thank you so much for all of your
         help!"--<i>Michelle Faulkenberry, Santee, California</i>

<p>"Sisterhood Bookstore means women, communication, great
         expectations, high energy, information and future
         knowledge."--<i>Jessie M. Ivy, Indianapolis</i></p>

<p>"I came to Los Angeles 10 years ago, alone, not knowing
         anyone, but wanting to connect to the lesbian community. My
         only hope was the <em>Gayellow Pages</em> a friend had
         packed in my suitcase. Flipping it open to L.A., the
         Sisterhood Bookstore entry jumped out at me. As fast as I
         could, I drove down to Westwood and joyously spent my first
         real afternoon in L.A. soaking in the wonderful feminist
         woman-centered atmosphere. Way in the back of the store, I
         found the <em>LN</em> and the rest is history. I am so glad
         now I can give back to the place that gave me so
         much."--<i>Thea Iberall, Long Beach</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"SISTERHOOD BOOKSTORE is one of the great jewels of
         Westwood: a civilized, welcoming, well-stocked, and, above
         all, an absolutely necessary place for the many of us who
         struggle for gender equality. Congratulations to SISTERHOOD
         for 25 years of fulfilling a vital mission. I am sure it
         will have many more years of success. And we must all make
         sure of that."--<i>Joan Palevsky, West Los Angeles</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"One day, while wandering through the neighborhood, I
         stopped in and began to browse. I found a book, quite by
         accident, which turned out to be one of the most thought
         provoking works I ever read. It changed the way I think
         about things. Thank you. I think you have lots of books like
         that. So, every now and then, I come by and shop through
         your shelves of other peoples minds."--<i>Tom Cook, Los
         Angeles</i></p>

<p>"Sisterhood Bookstore has meant that if I needed a source
         to open my mind, I could find it at your bookstore, if I
         needed a place to open my eyes, I could come to you. If I
         wanted to empower myself, I only needed to look to you for
         guidance, support and understanding. It is because of you
         that I came to call myself, proudly, feminist and
         womyn."--<i>Suzan Najarian-Kojoian, Los Angeles</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Now that I am writing full-time, I can truly appreciate
         the wealth of information and wisdom from the many
         Sisterhood books which I feel make it possible for me to
         write. When my first book, <em>Women Behind the Camera</em>,
         was published this year, Sisterhood was the first bookstore
         I turned to. Whatever I can do to help women writers and the
         community of women readers, please count me in."--<i>Alexis
         Krasilovsky, Los Angeles</i></p>
<p>"I have been coming to Sisterhood for 25 years. That same
         year I opened Of Books and Such, L.A.'s first children's
         book shop. We lasted 13 years. So warmest congrats!! In the
         last 5 years, I have been a 'student' of The Goddess and
         almost every book in my library has come from Sisterhood on
         this wonderful subject. And I thank you for that. I might
         add, most of my favorite earrings, necklaces, rings, candle
         holders, etc., came from behind your glass! Did I mention
         calenders and holiday cards? Long live independent
         bookstores, long live feminist bookstores. Long live
         Sisterhood!! Also, your workers are terrific!!" --<i>Lindy
         Michaels, Santa Monica</i>

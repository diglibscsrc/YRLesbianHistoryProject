<h4> ORIGINAL LETTER: </h4>
<p> 
        Date: Mon, 15 Jun 1998 09:45:29 -0500 <br/> From: Rachel Carson Homestead homestead@rachelcarson.org
        <br/> To: retter@calvin.usc.edu <br/> Subject: Rachel Carson 
        </p>
<p>
            I want to point out that Rachel Carson's official biographer, a woman who interviewed over 150 of Carson's colleagues and closest friends, pored over her personal correspondence and journals, and had access to every corner of her life, states unequivocally that she found no evidence to support the claim that Carson was a homosexual woman.</p>

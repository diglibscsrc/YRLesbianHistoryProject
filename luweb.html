<h4> * LU Mission Statement:</h4>
<p>  
Lesbianas Unidas seeks to be a grassroots organization that empowers
Latina lesbians. LU shall promote a unique culture that honors our
diversity and creates a sense of community by preserving our unique
herstory, honoring our accomplishmnets and organizing educational and
other projects that build pride. LU shall engage in political advocacy on
issues that affect our communities and shall promote projects and
undertake
actions that make us visible to the general public. Moreover, LU is
committed to struggle against racism, sexism, classism, ageism,
homophobia, biphobia and all other forms of oppression. Our strength lies
in the unity we foster by honoring the richness of our diversity.
</p>
<h4>* History of LU:</h4>
<p>
LU was formed in 1984 as a committee of Gay and Lesbian Latinos Unidos
(GLLU) which was founded in 1981. "Lesbianas Unidas was initially formed
to serve as a support group and to address the specific needs of
politicized, feminist Latina lesbians..." From an initial membership of
five women, LU has grown, and now has a mailing list of 500. Over the
years LU has struggled with the needs of members who want it to be a
political organization versus those who want it to be primarily a social
group. Over the years LU has done both. LU has sponsored an annual
retreat since 1984; marched in the 20th Anniversary of the Chicano
Moratorium March (1990); worked
with Connexxus Women's Center/Centro de Mujeres Latina Outreach Program;
attended the Lesbians of Color National Conference in 1983.
LU participates in the Dia de La Mujer/International
Women's Day annual celebration and the Latina Lesbian Encuentros. In 1994
LU separated from GLLU and became an independent group. LU members
continue to work on behalf of many causas and invite hermanas to
join us.

<h4>* Latina Lesbian Oral History Project: </h4>
<p>   
LU has just received a grant from LLEGO for a pilot project
that will begin to gather the history of Latina Lesbians in Los Angeles.
Ten lesbianas
who lived in the LA area before Stonewall (1969) and ten who were active 
in the LA lesbian movement between 1969-1979 will be individually
interviewed on videotape. In the fall of 1997, the project hosted a 1
day community forum. The program included clips from the
interviews, information on doing oral history interviews and a dialogo
between veteranas and those attending.
The intent is to gather information about the life and political
activities of Latina Lesbians. This is one step toward filling in the
gaps about our history and providing role models for other generations.
 The project is being done in collaboration with Lapis (at
the Alcoholism Center for Women) and The Lesbian Legacy Collection (ONE
Institute/International Gay and Lesbian Archives). We are looking for
any women who may have been politically active on behalf of lesbian
rights before 1969, as well as information about clubs, groups, etc. for 
Latina lesbians in the LA area before the 1970's.If you
want to participate in or help with this project, please contact us at:
 retter@calvin.usc.edu or Bridget at 213-381-8500.

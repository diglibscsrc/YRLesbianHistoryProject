ABSTRACT: Traces the history of the Lesbian Herstory Archives (LHA), 
in New York City, in the context of the growing field of Lesbian History
which emerged during the early 1970s. It attempts to explain why the 
preservation of written documents and cultural artifacts
is important to the Lesbian community, what social movements made the 
establishment of a Lesbian archive possible, how an
archive can facilitate Lesbian historical investigation, and why the 
archive has chosen to remain independent as opposed to
affiliating with an educational institution. Works in the field of Lesbian 
History and the History of Sexuality have been examined as have Archival 
publications, articles and the holdings of the collection. 
Interviews were conducted with Joan Nestle and Deborah Edel; 
two founders of the LHA who have remained dedicated to the collection 
since its inception. Judith Schwarz, the Lesbian Historian, was also 
interviewed.

      ABSTRACT:This contextual piece documents the creation and 
               development of the Project Demonstrating 
               Excellence, the Ohio Lesbian
|              Archives, a social action project created for the 
               purpose of communicating and preserving 
               the culture and organizations
|              of Lesbians in Ohio. Lesbians, more than most wimmin, 
               have  been written out of history. 
               Historical records about Lesbians were destroyed or not       
               well kept and so Lesbians are the last minority, 
               the invisible minority, although close to
               eleven percent of the world's population is homosexual.
|              Discussions about homosexuals generally conjure up 
               images of Gay men, popular culture has a negative view of 
               Lesbians through ignorance and anti-Gay propaganda. A safe
               factual and permanent space was needed for Lesbians and 
               others to learn and do research about Lesbians. Some 
               universities and libraries now have archives about 
               wimmin, but none has an exclusively Lesbian collection. The 
               Ohio Lesbian Archives, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, was 
               created to fulfill this need. A needs assessment, 
               conclusions and quantitative summary are presented 
               concerning the need for a Lesbian archives in Ohio. A 
               permanent and ongoing organizational and
               process infrastructure was developed to be built upon b
               future generations. Regular hours are currently 
               available to view books, newsletters, diaries, protest and 
               cancer materials, music, legal proceedings, photographs, 
               letters, essays, magazines and audio interviews, with a 
               particular focus on video taped oral herstories of 
               Lesbians. Successes include providing a permanent safe 
               space for Lesbians and
|              others to gain factual information about Lesbians and their
|              culture, a permanent building and responsibility
|              infrastructure, raising funds in sufficient number to
               expand, public relations work in television, radio, printed
|              media, and especially video taped oral herstories of
|              Lesbians. This work is to be viewed as a continuum of
|              scholars, to be built upon by future researchers.

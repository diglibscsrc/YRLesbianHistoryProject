<th height="774" width="213">
<p><b>By Camilla Snyder</b></p>
<p><b>Herald-Examiner Staff Writer</b></p>
<p align="LEFT">It seems inevitable that a movement which
         spawned its own magazine, 'Ms.', and its own writers:
         Millet, de Beauvoir, Morgan, Reeves, Greer, friedan, et al,
         would eventually also bring forth its own bookshop. It has
         happened right here in West Los Angeles.</p>
<p align="LEFT">For those who shun the strident, man-hating
         breed of feminists who seem to abound in the women's
         liberation movement, the trio of young women who opened the
         Sisterhood Bookstore come as a welcome relief. All three
         Ms's, Simone Gold, Adele Wallace and Gayen Phillips are also
         Mrs.'s; what's more, they are happily married. Mrs. Gold and
         Mrs. Phillips have children and Mrs. Wallace expects her
         first child any day now.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The Sisterhood partners are an 'in-bred'
         group; Mrs. Gold and Mrs. Wallace are sisters-in-law while
         Gayen Phillips is Simone Gold's cousin-in-law. The group
         have intellectual as well as family ties which is why they
         chose to open a feminist book shop in place of a feminist
         dress shop or game shop.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"We all love books, and we are all UCLA
         graduates," Mrs. Gold whose B.A. is in English explained.
         "Adele has a degree in elementary education while Gayen has
         a degree in psychology."</p>
<p align="LEFT">In addition to her training in matters
         psychological, Phillips has a talent for carpentry which is
         both impressive and apropos in these non-sexist times. She
         designed, and with her partners' help made, all the book
         shelves for the back-off-the-street shop at 1915 3/4
         Westwood Blvd.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"We wanted to put our capital (each partner
         contributed $1000 to the shop) into stock," Gayen explained.
         "So I went to a lumber yard with my blueprints, selected
         pine which we stained, and built the shelves. You will
         notice that each shelf slants just enough so that the titles
         are easy to read and books easy to get at."
      </p></th><th height="774" width="213">
<p align="LEFT">The Sisterhood Bookstore opened quietly
         compared to the razzamatazz of the recent Brentano debut
         here; coffee and cookies, chips and dips which the girls
         made themselves were offered to guests, and the opening had
         a style -- sort of homespun intellectual -- of its own.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Now that the partners have been in business a
         full month, they have sorted out their pleasures and their
         problems. "We are pleased that we have so many men
         customer," 30-year old Adele Wallace remarked. "I would
         estimate that 70 per cent of our clientele are women while
         30 per cent are men. And we have an unusual number of
         children on our books."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Non-sexist children's books, that is volumes
         which show boys and girls in a variety of roles are a big
         feature of the shop. As Simone Gold explains:</p>
<p align="LEFT">"In our children's books, the girls do not
         always stand watch as the boys toboggan down the hill. In so
         many children's books the girls watch, to boys do. Girls
         seldom show qualities of courage, ingenuity. By the same
         token boys seldom show qualities of caring for people or
         artistic talents like painting. Everything in most
         children's books is so rigid. Girls are emotional, boys are
         clever when we know that all people are both."</p>
<p align="LEFT">Adele Wallace noted that a book called, 'Quiet
         on Account of Dinosaur,' was a good example of what a
         non-sexist children's book should be. "It's about a little
         girl who discovers a dinosaur. She sees his tail outside a
         cage, pulls on the tail. Now you have to admit that's a
         courageous thing for a little girl -- or for anybody -- to
         do. The little girl in this book becomes an expert on
         dinosaurs. She goes on and becomes a museum expert on
         dinosaurs, ends up with a Ph.D. and a curatorial job at a
         museum."
      </p></th><th height="774" width="213">
<p align="LEFT">It seems unlikely that Mmes. Gold, Wallace or
         Phillips will go on for Ph.D.'s of their own; they are far
         too fascinated with their business prospects.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"We just can't stay away from the store,"
         Simone Gold said adding that the 10 a.m through 6 p.m.
         hours, Monday through Saturday, did make some involved
         babysitting and housekeeping arrangements necessary.</p>
<p align="LEFT">There are plenty of shop 'chores' to keep the
         three occupied. Authors come in for advice on who might
         publish their books, artists stop in about exhibits of their
         works. Then there are book buying chores.</p>
<p align="LEFT">"Getting books is the big problem," Simone
         Gold explains. "Publishers in New York are so far away. A
         lot of times they aren't very cooperative. They refuse to
         deal in cash. We will send a check and say 'If you want to
         wait until it clears before sending our books fine.' Now we
         have a credit rating with the Central Publishing People so
         things are better. Then, too, the Feminist Press and a group
         called Lollipop Power in Virginia plus Schockin Publishing
         in New York are fine to deal with."</p>
<p align="LEFT">A poster on the wall of the Sisterhood
         Bookstore features a diaper ad reprint which reads 'The
         Future President of the United States Deserves a Drier
         Bottom.' Another poster proselytizes "There will never be a
         truly liberated man until there are liberated women." The
         Sisterhood Bookstore would seem to be dispensing brotherhood
         and idealistic parenthood along with a nourshing diet of
         reading material (72 titles, mostly paperback, plus
         magazines and some non-sexist games) for those in the West
         Los Angeles area. And the shop owners already speak of
         opening their second shop. After all, the first month's
         gross was $3000. Not bad for a business capitalized at $3000
         in an out of the way location.</p>

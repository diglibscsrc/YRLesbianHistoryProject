<h3> DYKE MARCHES: A HERSTORY </h3>
<p>
Yolanda Retter
<p>
Lesbian in/visibility in the co-gender movement has been an issue  since
homosexual women and men began organizing. In the 1970s, "Gay Liberation"
was an umbrella term that was supposed to include both lesbians and gay
males. With the advent of feminism and analyses of sexism, lesbians who
felt that their agenda was being subsumed under a male one, left to form
their own movement and/or demanded that the term "lesbian" be used to
distinguish female homosexuals from male ones. 
<p>
One sees the effects of this demand in the name changes that co-gender
organizations founded in the early 1970s, made in the 1980s. For example,
the National Gay Task Force became NGLTF, by adding the "L" word to its
name. Similarly, the Gay Community Services Center in Los Angeles, became
the GLCSC for a time.
<p>
One 90s response to the invisibility of lesbians was Lesbian Avengers,
founded in 1992 by six New York lesbian activists who wanted a lesbian
direct-action group. The Avengers soon gained a reputation for engaging in
guerrilla-type "zaps," street theatre and other political actions.
According to Sarah Schulman, a co-founder of the Avengers, the group
decided to have a lesbian march as part of the 1993 March on Washington. 
<p>
Great ideas sometimes manifest simultaneously. Judy Sisneros, a member  of
the National ACT UP Women's Committee, recalls that in late 1992, her
group also began networking to produce a march, and later collaborated
with the Lesbian Avengers and other D.C. groups.  The first Dyke march
drew 20,000 women. As a point of principle, no permit was obtained.
According to Sarah Schulman, it was "the largest lesbian event in the
history of the world." When the March reached the White House on its way
to the Washington Monument, the Avengers stopped and demonstrated their
prowess as fire-eaters. This activity has become a trademark of the
Avengers.
<p>
Sarah Schulman, noted that by the summer of 1993, "the Dyke March had
caught on around the country." The first San Francisco Dyke March in 1993,
drew 10,000 women, while the one in New York City drew 3000. Chicago held
its first march in 1996,  and 1000 women showed up. The first LA March in
1994, drew 350 women, while 1500 showed up for the one in 1997.  Lesbian
activist veterans from the 1970s who attend the L.A. Dyke March, will note
that unlike marches from the 1970s, these events are multi-generational,
and multicultural. 
<p>
Attempts to create a lesbian presence during gay pride, is like most
lesbian projects, vulnerable to controversy.  Some lesbians and gay men
disapprove of a "separate" or  "radical" lesbian event. Lesbians involved
in organizing the event itself, may also differ vehemently with one
another about political ideology. For example, in 1998, long-time lesbian
activist Alix Dobkin, was invited to sing and speak at the Philadelphia
Dyke March. However, after Alix wrote an article in Chicago's Frontlines,
on the importance of lesbian-only space and its not being open to Male-to
Female transgender people, she was "disinvited" by the March organizers.
In the end after much debate and struggle, she was reinvited.  
<p>
Internationally, the idea of lesbian-focused pride marches has begun to
catch on. The first Dyke March in Vancouver, British Columbia, was held in
June, 1995. Ireland held its first Dyke March in 1998.  In the same year,
Toronto held its third Dyke March. As in other dyke marches, dykes on
bykes, leather, bare breasts, waving flags, cheering, singing and dancing
were part of the event. 
<p>
In Japan, according to The Daily Yomiuri  newspaper, "More  than 200
people" participated in the "Dyke March, Tokyo '97." At the event, "women,
many with buzz cuts and wearing karate uniforms or black suits, paraded
along a six-kilometer route...loud music blaring from portable stereos and
the colorful costumes attracted the most attention."
<p>
The Dyke March signifies an attempt to promote lesbian activism and
visibility in a co-gender, often politically apathetic environment, where
many agendas compete for contributors and participants. Lisa Kung, a
founding member of Atlanta Avengers, noted that the Dyke March "is about
empowerment [for lesbians]."
<p>
In the midst of a co-gender movement that also seeks to integrate
transgendered, bisexual and intersexed constituencies, the Dyke March, is
a symbol of lesbian visibility, specificity, longevity and diversity.
<p>
The 1999 Los Angeles Dyke march will take place on June 12, at 7 pm. Meet
at "Lesbo Park" on the corner of Doheny and Santa Monica Boulevard, in
West Hollywood

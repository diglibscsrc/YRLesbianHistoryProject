<b>Marilyn Murphy 
<br>
By Brook Shumway 
</b>
<p>
It was early summer of 1977 and I had just returned to Los Angeles. I had 
recently experienced the soap opera break-up of my first lesbian 
relationship. This resulted in being kicked out of my apartment and 
needing a new place to live. Not knowing many people in L.A., I found 
myself walking into the Gay and Lesbian Community Center.  The first 
person I met was Marilyn. She was working at the Center. After a few 
minutes of explaining my situation, Marilyn revealed that she was in need 
of a roommate and wondered if I was interested. We had experienced an 
instantaneous connection. I felt I had just met my long lost sister. 
Little did I know that that
moment would be a momentous one. My life was 
definitely taking a step in the right direction. 
<p>
Within a week or two of moving in with Marilyn, it was time for the 
Lesbian Feminist Camp named "Califia".  She and Irene were founding 
mothers, and that camp was just the beginning of a wonderful year of 
living with Marilyn. I went quickly from struggling thru "Feminism 101" to 
taking a crash course in graduate level Feminism. The Women's Movement was 
charging full-steam ahead and so was Marilyn. Marilyn was involved with 
someone else when I first moved in with her. But about six months later 
that relationship had dissolved and she was soon spending increasing time 
with her friend...Irene. These were amazing, life-changing times for me 
and for her.  Living with Marilyn was a whirlwind of feminist and lesbian 
discussions into the wee hours of the morning, wonderful parties full of 
exciting lesbians, debates about topics I knew nothing about: racism, 
sexism, classism and all the other "isms". Being introduced to new books, 
new thoughts, undiscovered (to me) women authors. It was a life-changing 
year. It was the "best of times." 
<p>
And then I had the privilege of being there to witness the blossoming of 
Marilyn and Irene's love affair.  I am still at a loss to know what to 
call their relationship. To see two fine, strong, smart, amazing women do 
their romantic dance together. It was not a "marriage"...Marilyn would 
bristle at that description. But it was certainly a respectful and 
exciting union of two fine women. They were trying to build a relationship 
that was based on staying together as long as it was viable.  They were 
not to be bound together out of obligations, necessity, or any of the 
other labels that hold couples together. The debates on issues and the 
passion about feminism and lesbianism were building blocks. Not for a 
moment was their romance boring or blase. Instead, their relationsnhip was 
blazing, passionate and not without its conflicts. These two strong women 
had finally met their respective matches. There would be no "one-up-woman 
ship". They were equal.  They had both finally met someone smart enough, 
tough enough, feminist enought, lesbian enough, sexy enough and funny 
enough. They reached a home-coming that would endure for many seasons. 
<p>
I moved away after a year with Marilyn, but my friendship did not end 
there. There were many years to come of sharing the changes in all our 
lives. There were good times and some very sad times. Marilyn and Irene 
retired and subsequently discovered the joys of RV'ing. They tortured me 
for years with postcards from around America and Canada, giving me 
tantalizing glimpses of dreamy places. I knew I wanted to grow up and 
become just like them...full-time RV'ers. After four years of being on the 
road, they settled in the lesbian haven of the Pagoda in St. Augustine, 
Florida. I was able to visit them about once a year while they were there. 
They were instrumental players in defining that community. 
<p>
Later on they relocated to Apache Junction, Arizona to join another 
women's community as well as part year at Discover Bay in Washington. The 
beauty of Discovery Bay resonated into Marilyn's being. 
<p>
In retrospect, I was to have one final outstanding experience with 
Marilyn. I was lucky enough to have a terrific trip with Marilyn and Irene 
to France. We traveled for an entire month in the early summer of 1996. My 
partner Beth and I had thought it would be great fun if we rented a car 
and drove the four of us around France. Irene had been there as a young 
woman but the rest of us had never visited. We embarked on a month of 
exploration with no set itinerary except to see the most of France that we 
could. Irene was fascinated with the Camargue region and the wild horses 
that roamed the area. I relish the memories of the four of us on a private 
jeep tour through the wilds of the Camargue viewing flamingoes, the white 
Camargue horses, the Spanish and Camargue bulls. It was terrific. None of 
us could speak much French. Mainly we knew "restaurant French" and as I 
say, "what more did we need?" Marilyn managed to find simple comfort food 
in the form of a "Croque Monsieur" sandwich (grilled ham and cheese). That 
to me is so "Marilyn". She was a simple working class woman without 
pretenses. A grilled ham and cheese sandwich in France was her perfect 
meal. Top it off with a good cup of coffee or a sweet dessert and she was 
wonderfully satisfied. It was a priceless experience. 
<p>
As so often happens in life, we don't always realize the gifts we have 
until we begin to lose them.  Looking back, I would have to say that the 
France trip may have been one of the last times that Marilyn was at her 
peak. It seemed that shortly after the France trip she began her long 
descent into "the slow death that had no name."  It has been 
heart-wrenching to watch the slow deterioration of such a smart, vital, 
feisty woman. I feel privileged that I knew her at the prime of her life.  
The life she endured the past few years was not one any of us would ever 
choose.  It seemed so cruel that she would lose her most vital abilities 
and passions:  to read, debate, analyze, speak forcefully, share stories, 
make us laugh, force us to examine our own biases and prejudices. She was 
trapped in a body that would not cooperate. To see her struggle to make 
sentences, to tell stories, and to remember simple words was 
heart-breaking. Many of us became unrecognizable to her as she struggled 
to figure out who we were. Her frustration must have been unbelievable. 
<p>
And so her life has ended.  Of course there is a relief to be felt that 
her suffering has come to an end.  But that doesn't mean that the loss is 
not real. I know for myself that the memories that I shall always treasure 
will not be the images of the past few years. Instead, I will selectively 
play back the "mind movies" of how I met her, how I enjoyed hearing her 
speak and laugh. I will hear her stories of growing up in New York. The 
family tales of her mother and her sisters. The powerful, dynamic speaker. 
The feisty debater who could invent words and phrases. The righter of 
wrongs. The defender of the forgotten. She would never be silent in the 
face of injustices. She spoke boldly and loudly until you could not fail 
to hear her. The writer, the sister, the educator, the friend. In my heart 
she will always be my dear friend. I am blessed that I shared a few 
moments in time with her. I loved her.

<b> From Marilyn's Daughter: </b>

Aloha Yolanda,
My name is Ena, Marilyn's (lesbian)daughter.
Would it be possible to print this piece I wrote about my mother?
I think she would like it.
Aloha,   Ena
<b>Marilyn Murphy.........passes </b>

Pray to Mary when you need help. Jesus is so busy and he has to do 
what his mother tells him so... Pray to Mary.
These were the instructions given to me as a child, by my mother, 
Marilyn Murphy, forever the feminist, even before her own conscious awareness. 

In fact Marilyn started out life as the eldest of the five Murphy Sisters 
(she was born to create women's space). Each of her sisters, exceptional, 
women, in their own right, loved their big sister Marilyn, using her as 
inspiration in their own lives.  The mantra of their youth... the girls 
have to stick together, saw them through the struggles of early life 
in New York City, later as women in Oklahoma and later still as the 
Murphy girls migrated west to California, one at a time, the mantra 
still resonating!

The girls have to stick together! The girls have to stick together!
She passed this belief on to her daughters and to every woman she met, 
whether she was in Oklahoma in the 50s raising her children, later, at a 
women's event, in an R.V. park or in the line at a grocery store. Her 
message of freedom was always on her lips.

At age ten, in Tulsa, she took me to picket in front of Howard 
Johnsons Restaurant,(they wouldnt serve blacks). At thirteen she gave me 
the Autobiography of Malcolm X, soon to be followed by Germane Greer and 
an endless list of must reading.

Marilyn was driven by a need to be free and a need to help other 
women to be free. She dedicated her life to this struggle and now we 
continue on with her as our ancestor.

Thank you Marilyn........Sister, Mother, Lover, Teacher.   
We love you and we know how much you loved us all!
We will remember what you taught us: The girls have to stick together!

Marilyn Murphy, a radical lesbian feminist activist died on November 8, at 
the age of 72 in Arizona. She had been in poor health since suffering a 
stroke some years ago. Marilyn was born in New York City June 19, 1932, 
the first of five daughters. Her working class background later inspired 
and directed her ardent activism on behalf of class issues within the 
women's and lesbian movements. Before her career as an activist, Marilyn 
married, had four children and earned a master's degree. She moved to 
California in 1965, divorced, struggled to support her children and came 
out at the age of 43. 
<p>
In 1975, she attended Sagaris, a women's institute where she felt a lack 
of equality between organizers and attendees. She and others returned to 
California determined to create an organization that was different. In 
1976, she helped found Califia (1976-1986), known for both its weeklong 
campouts that drew hundreds of women and its memorable class and race 
workshops. During that time, Marilyn also helped found the San Fernando 
Valley Rape Crisis Services center and worked at the Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center (GLCSC) in Los Angeles promoting women's 
programs, including an early lesbians over 40 group. The year 1977 held 
great significance for Marilyn: She 
was one of ten out lesbians elected to go to the International 
Womens' Year Conference in Houston as part of the California delegation. 
That delegation was instrumental in persuading thousands of delegates, 
most of whom were heterosexual, to pass a pro-lesbian resolution. 
She also met Irene Weiss and began what she thought would be a "brief 
affair," but one that lasted 27 years.
<p>
Marilyn once wrote that her "two secret childhood ambitions were to sing 
in a nightclub in a sequined gown and to write an opinion column for a 
newspaper." She was happy to have realized one of them, when in 1982 she 
joined the Lesbian News to write a column, "Lesbianic Logic." In it she 
discussed and made candid observations
about topics of 
debate within the 
community, ranging from Classism to Bisexuality, from Lipstick 
lesbians to Ageism. After 
Irene retired, they moved to Florida to be part of the Pagoda, an early 
woman's residential community. In 1995 they moved to another woman's 
community in Arizona and spent their summers in Washington state at 
another women's community. 
<p>
Marilyn contributed her writing to a number of anthologies including Out 
of the Class Closet and was the author of Are You Girls Traveling Alone?, 
a selection of her Lesbian News columns. In the introduction to Are You 
Girls... writer and philosopher, Marilyn Frye noted that Marilyn Murphy's 
feminist analysis "evolves coherently from a central and passionate 
philogyny (the opposite of misogyny) an intelligent and engaged loving 
perception of women." 
<p>
Marilyn's partner Irene recalls that, "What Marilyn loved most was 
reading,
analyzing and exploring women's issues with other women. These discussions 
were the bread and butter and champagne and caviar of her life.She also 
loved writing her articles and essays and having them published.And last, 
she loved our home, our cats, and our personal interactions as lovers, 
equal partners,and best friends, during our 27 year 'brief affair.'" (For 
more on the "brief afair," see Are You Girls...). The hundreds of lesbians 
who knew Marilyn through her indefatigable activism on behalf of women 
will miss her. She is survived by her life-partner and activist colleague, 
Irene Weiss, her four children, her sisters, nieces, nephews and 
grandchildren. A service will be held in Los Angeles early next year.

<b>UNITED STATES/HAWAII:</b> December, 3 --   For
the first time in U.S. history a state court ruled Tuesday that civil
marriage law cannot discriminate
against lesbian and gay couples. A Hawaii court ruled in the case brought
by Honolulu civil rights lawyer Dan Foley and Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund on behalf of three lesbian and gay couples.<br/><br/>
...From Honolulu, Foley, who litigated Baehr v. Miike from its earliest
stages, said, "Judge Kevin Chang made the only decision that he could,
given the evidence in this case.  This decision is not only historic, but
of vital personal consequence to the couples who want to get married."
<br/> <br/>
Foley added, "Now that the court has ruled, the state should immediately
issue civil marriage licenses to the couples in this case."
Foley, through the Hawaii Equal Rights Marriage Project, and Wolfson
presented the case for two lesbian couples and one gay male couple
seeking civil marriage licenses in Hawaii.
<br/> <br/>
The three couples, Ninia Baehr and Genora Dancel, Pat Lagon and Joseph
Melillo, and Antoinette Pregil and Tammy Rodrigues were denied marriage
licenses by the state Department of Health in late 1990.  In 1991, they
jointly filed a lawsuit alleging the denial was unconstitutional and
eventually the case was appealed to the Hawaii Supreme Court.
<br/> <br/>
In 1993, the state Supreme Court ruled that, under Hawaii's Constitution,
allowing civil marriage licenses only for opposite-sex couples and not
for same-sex couples is sex discrimination.  The court ordered the state
to show what "compelling" interest justifies such discrimination in civil
marriage. Judge Chang of the First Circuit Court of Hawaii heard the case
at a nine-day, bench trial, September 10-20.  Deputy state Attorney
General Rich Eichor argued on behalf of Director Lawrence Miike of the
state Department of Health, which has jurisdiction over marriage licenses.
..<br/> <br/>
Two of the plaintiffs in the landmark case, Ninia Baehr and Genora
Dancel,
who now live in Baltimore, quickly stated their exuberance with the
ruling. "Many people around the country helped break through this wall of
discrimination.  While we face much more work ahead to secure this right
nationally, Ninia and I are deeply honored to be part of today's
victory," Dancel said. "Our love made it possible for me and Genora to get
through this long legal fight," Baehr said.  "I'm looking forward to our
love getting us to our wedding on a mountain slope in Maui," she said.
<br/> <br/>
Lambda Legal Director Beatrice Dohrn said.  "Without civil marriage, gay
couples often face painful, difficult situations, like being barred from
the hospital bedside of a partner in a medical emergency. Lesbian and gay
couples have had no access to the legal, economic, and practical
protections of
civil marriage that non-gay couples can take for granted."
Other protections withheld from gay couples include access to family
health
coverage, immigration, divorce, and inheritance rights.  Lesbians and gay
men also are denied protection for their children and may lose custody
when their partner dies...

<b>ARGENTINA</b>
 (August) - Buenos Aires Statutory Convention unanimously
approved an antidiscriminatory clause honoring 'the right to be different'
and
forbiding discrimination on the grounds of gender, age, race, religion,
political ideology and sexual orientation. Thus, Buenos Aires has become
the
first Spanish speaking city in Latin America to guarantee this type of
protection to its citizens.
<br/> <br/>
Two discourses were rewarded by an
standing ovation coming from us as well as from the rest of the public and
even
from a few representatives themselves: those uttered by Maria Jose
Lubertino
(Union Civica Radical) and Eugenio Zaffaroni (FREPASO). Lubertino's -the
project advocate, with a well known and highly valued background in the
Feminist and Youth movements- had a solid theoretical base together with
strong
personal involvement, and ended by saying: "To approve this clause is for
me
like saying: I'm a Jew, I'm Black, I'm the old woman who hangs herself
because
her retirement pension is not enough for a living, I'm the lesbian who is
jailed for kissing her lover in the street...".

countries and territories.ORGUYO can be contacted at

<b>UNITED STATES</b>, July 13 -- The House (of Representatives) overwhelmingly 
passed a bill Friday to restrict same sex 
marriages, after an emotional and highly personal debate that included 
impassioned pleas from several openly gay lawmakers. 
The ``Defense of Marriage Act'' passed on a 342-67 vote with two members 
abstaining by voting ``present.'' It was sent to the Senate, where all 
sides expect it to pass when it is considered in September or October.
President Clinton has promised to sign it when it reaches his desk. 
Conservatives said the legislation was necessary to preserve the 
institution of marriage from homosexual
extremists who threatened the moral and religious fiber of America. 
<br/><br/>
Under the bill the federal government would for the first time define 
marriage, establishing it as the union of one man and one woman. 
The bill withholds federal recognition of same-sex marriages, denying 
Social Security, veterans' and other benefits to such unions. It also says 
states need not recognize such marriages made in other states, a power
opponents of the bill say the states have already. 
<br/><br/>
Rep. Steve Gunderson, a Wisconsin Republican who is one of the three 
openly members of the House, was anguished in his opposition. 
``Why are we so mean?'' he asked his fellow House members. ''Why must we 
attack one element of our society for cheap political gain? Why must we 
pursue the politics of division and fear?'' He said that his partner
of 13 years should be entitled to the same health insurance ``as 
individuals around here with second and third wives.'' 
And he said people had often been denied the right to sign papers at 
funeral homes after the death of long-time partners, or to consult with 
doctors when partners were hospitalized. No state now permits same-sex 
marriages and 11 have banned them but pending court action in Hawaii 
could allow such marriages in that state, although not for several years. 
<br/><br/>
Some supporters of the bill used the debate as a chance to make a broad 
condemnation of homosexuality.  ``Homosexuality has been discouraged in 
all cultures because it is inherently wrong,'' said Rep. David
Funderburk, a North Carolina Republican. And Rep. Stephen Buyer, an 
Indiana Republican, said the basic issue was religious.  ``God laid down 
that one man and one woman is a legal union,'' he 
declared. ``That God-given principle is under attack. There are those in 
society that try to shift us away from a society based on religious 
principles to humanistic principles.'' 
<br/><br/>
Replied Rep. Gerry Studds, a Massachusetts Democrat who is openly 
homosexual: ``I thought for a moment I was in a revival meeting.'' 
Some opponents called the attitude of proponents bigotry. But Rep. Charles 
Canady, a Florida Republican, said 70 percent of Americans supported the 
bill and it was wrong to insult people who represented such a large
majority. ``Seventy percent of the American people are not bigots,'' he 
declared. But Rep. John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, disagreed. 
``May I remind you, sir, that 70 percent of the population was against 
ending segregation when the civil rights laws passed in the United States 
in the sixties?'' said Conyers, who is black. He suggested prejudice against
homosexuals will eventually go out of public fashion, as it did for blacks.

<b>LONDON</b>, 28th of June: The passing on of human intelligence is exclusively
done by the female x-chromosome. This was published on friday in the
medical magazine Lancet as a result of a secondary-study done by the
geneticist Gillian Turner. The scientist recommends that men pay more
attention to mental abilities while searching (for a)  partner. The 
popular opinion that children inherit their mother's beauty and father's
intelligence is genetically disproved.

<b>ALL RUSSIA </b> -- The 3rd All-Russian Gay and Lesbian Conference was held on 
June 7-9 1996 on the initiative of the Moscow gay and lesbian organization 
Tsentr Treugolnik ("Triangle Center"). 150 participants from all over 
Russia gathered for the conference in Moscow...More than 20 gay and 
lesbian organizations exist nowadays in 14 regions in Russia...
On the eve of the presidential election, the conference worked out 
its POLITICAL POSITION. Because of the considerable difference of 
opinions expressed by the participants, the conference couldn't speak in 
support for one certain candidate for president. Nevertheless, the 
conference passed a resolution in regards to the election. The 
participants remembered the 60 years of the anti-homosexual terror and 
appealed to the whole Russian gay and lesbian community, the families and 
friends of gays and lesbians to vote against those, who want to restore 
the communist regime in Russia....The workshop "GAY PRESS" presented the 
simultaneous growth of the Russian gay and lesbian press and the gay and 
lesbian rights movement. While most organizations are working in large 
cities, the press remains, for gays and lesbians in the provinces, the 
only source of information and is in many cases a substitute for 
homosexual community...E-mail: triangle@glas.apc.org

<b>ICELAND</b> -- Parliament in Iceland - the Althingi - has passed a law on 
the cohabitation of people of the same gender, so-called Registered
Partnership. On 27 June, Gay Pride Day, Icelandic lesbians and
gays gain the right to enter into marriage before the law. The
bill is similar to those passed in Norway, Denmark and
Sweden, but it also gives gay couples joint custody of the children of
either partner. Both partners then become the children's
guardians and should the natural parent die, the other partner -
the children's step parent - automatically becomes their sole
guardian. Nowhere have gay couples had such rights up to now.
In addition to this the parliament is scheduled to change several
provisions in the criminal law, making it a punishable offence to
defame or persecute gays and lesbians in public.
Though a great victory has been won, the new law differs in some
ways from the general laws on marriage. It does not permit the
adoption of children by gay or lesbian couples, nor does it provide for
the right to artificial insemination. In addition, the law only permits 
gay and lesbian couples to confirm their partnership in a civil ceremony.

<b>FRANCE:</b> June 23 -- Tens of thousands of gays and lesbians 
marched in Paris and other major French cities  
Saturday in support of legal recognition for homosexual couples.
Protesters were seeking a ``contract of social union'' giving gay and
lesbian couples a formal legal status ensuring them equal rights with
heterosexuals in such matters as housing, inheritance and taxes.
The Paris march, coinciding with the capital's annual Lesbian and Gay
Pride festival, was the biggest of the day in France, with an estimated
80,000 participants -- 20,000 more than a similar march last year.
The protest had a festive air, with many marchers wearing wild 
costumes and hair died bright green, orange or red.
Similar but smaller marches took place in Rennes and Marseilles.
France's opposition Socialist Party said this week it would ask
parliament to approve legal status for homosexual couples.
French law does not now recognize gay or lesbian marriages although a
handful of cities issue certificates of cohabitation to same-sex couples.
The certificates have no legal weight but entitle gay couples to certain
rights such as discounts on the national rail system.

<b>TURKEY</b>: 14 Jun --On friday, the
Gay/lesbian/bisexual organization Kaos organized the first open
event in istanbul for gays/lesbians/bisexuals! It was such a wonderful 
evening:up on the 5th floor of the restaurant Bilsak,near Taksim, with a large 
view on the Bosphorus all around!! It was crowded, and Gunez, the young dyke 
we met earlier, read a statement before we all started to push away the tables, 
and got dancing until very late!! I really admired Gunez, it is very brave to 
organize openly such an event. She told us that the police was harassing 
transsexuals a lot, in Istanbul, even set fire to the places 
where they used to meet

<b>FINLAND</b>:28 May -- A bill regarding same-sex partnerships has been submitted. 
The law bill suggests that two persons of the same sex could form a 
(legally binding) partnership. The regulations on
the conditions of forming and dissolving such a partnership would be 
correspond to those regulating marriage with a
few exceptions. However, such a partnership would not mean marriage in its
traditional sense....
Three Nordic countries, viz. Sweden, Norway and Demark have already 
enacted laws on (legally binding) same sex
partnerships. The Parliament of the Republic of Iceland is presently
processing a corresponding law bill submitted by
the Cabinet. A central issue in the Scandinavian legislation is that the 
laws concerning the same sex partnership are
not included in the marriage legislation of these countries.
...The first signatory to the bill was Ms Outi Ojala, MP (Leftist 
Alliance) and the bill has been signed by 45 MPs...

<b>AUSTRALIA (May) -</b>
Here in Melbourne, a judge has just awarded damages to a lesbian who
brought charges against the police who raided a gay and lesbian night club
2 years ago and strip searched all 463 people in the club (supposedly on
suspicion of possessing drugs).  It looks as though the police are going
to settle out of court with the other (over a hundred) people who are
taking legal action - it could cost them around 2.5 mill.  Incentive
for them not to do anything so silly again, since money probably worries
them more than bad publicity.  (They only charged 4 people at the
original raid - and one of them turned out to have been in possession of
anti asthma drugs) (Eurosappho mailing list, 5/21/96).

<b>HUNGARY:
May 21 </b> -- Common-law relationships between 
homosexuals will
be recognized under a law adopted Tuesday by Hungary's Parliament.
   The new law will entitle gays to inherit property from their partners and
receive a deceased partner's pension, but will not allow them to adopt
children.
   Parliament members approved the civil code amendment 207 to 73, with 
fiveabstentions.
   The amendment was required after a Constitutional Court ruled in March
1995 that recognition of common-law relationships must be extended to
homosexual couples.
   ``This will help homosexuals to live together in a legal framework,''gay
rights activist Laszlo Rusvai, 35, told The Associated Press. ``I hope this
ruling will help the further demolition of social prejudices.''
  Hungary has no statistics on the size of its homosexual community, but gay
activists estimate that between 5 and 10 percent of the country's 10 
million people are gay.

<b>UNITED STATES/COLORADO:
Monday May 20.</b> Reuters News Summary -- MAJOR DECISION ON GAY RIGHTS . 
The Supreme Court has struck down as 
unconstitutional a Colorado statute outlawing legal
protections intended solely for homosexuals. The court resolved its first 
major gay-rights decision in 10 years with a 6-3 vote. Colorado
voters approved the 1992 measure barring the state or local governments 
from adopting laws protecting gays as an amendment to the state
constitution. But Justice Anthony Kennedy says the law unfairly targets 
people based on a single trait -- their sexual preference -- then
denies them the possibility of legal protections across the board.

Art.365 that criminalize
sodomy under the Chilean Penal Code- and the ending of Human Rights 
violations against homosexuals.

<b>UNITED STATES: </b> 
Thurs., May 9, 1996 --
Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole is pandering to 
extremists 
by becoming the first U.S. senator to co-sponsor a national bill to 
prohibit equal marriage rights for lesbian and gay Americans. Dole, R-Kan. 
and the Senate majority leader, has co-sponsored S. 1740, the "Defense of 
Marriage Act," introduced Wednesday by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
"Rather than moving to the center, Senator Dole is again pandering to
extremists in a desperate election-year bid to score political points at 
the expense of lesbian and gay Americans," said HRC Executive Director 
Elizabeth Birch. "It really says something that Bob Dole felt driven to 
jump onto this bill even before Congress' most militant anti-gay zealots, 
like Jesse Helms. It's just one more piece of evidence that Dole is 
floundering for an agenda." The Human Rights Campaign issued a report 
Wednesday exposing the orchestrated efforts of
religious political extremist groups to pass anti-marriage bills in at 
least 34 states. U.S. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced an anti-gay 
marriage bill in the House on Tuesday. It has a handful of 
co-sponsors. Currently, 
lesbian and gay couples cannot get legally married anywhere in the United 
States. Hawaii, the only state that is anywhere near the
&gt;&gt;possibility of extending equal marriage rights to gay people, will 
probably not resolve the issue for at least two more years.
... Dole's co-sponsorship of the Senate bill is not his first action on 
the
issue during the presidential race. In February, he sent a letter of 
support to the organizers of an anti-gay rally in Des Moines, Iowa, 
endorsing their anti-marriage resolution but saying that it "does not go far 
enough."

<b>NETHERLANDS</b>: 17 April 1996 -- 
A Moral Victory But Battles Still Ahead:
Yesterday in the Hague, the Dutch House of Representatives approved a motion
for the government to investigate the possibility of gay marriage by a vote
of 81 to 60.
While the news is being widely reported around Europe and the World, news
reports have not been making the facts clear: while this paves the way for
what would be full marriage rights for same-gender couples, the battle is
not won yet. Many journalists and reporters have jumped to the conclusion
that the issue is moving much quicker than it actually is.oop Van Der 
Linden, of the Dutch national gay and lesbian organization,
COC, explained: The motion approved is to ask the government to appoint a
commission to look into two issues. First: the opening of marriage to
same-sex couples with the resulting international and national implications;
Second; the opening up of adoption to same-sex couples, and the resulting
international implications. As in Scandinavian countries with their
"registered partnerships," Dutch officials worry about the adoption issue.
Many adopted children come from countries where homophobic officials might
prohibit adoption if they believe the child will be placed in lesbian or gay
household.
The commission must present the results of the research before 1 August
1997. Then, a further discussion will have to take place, and any proposed
law will have to go through more discussions and votes. Members of the
senate and government are opposed to same-sex marriage. Still, the COC is
calling the development "a moral victory."

<b>UNITED STATES/CALIFORNIA</b>:
(Mar. 25)-- Laura Ann Richardson,
Democratic candidate 
for California State Assembly in District 54 (Long
Beach), attacked her Democratic opponent in the primary election for
being an "openly lesbian candidate" and a supporter of "radical" gay
rights in an outrageously homophobic, last-minute mailer received by
angry residents on Friday.
     Richardson, who considers herself a progressive candidate, attacks
her opponent, Gerrie Schipske, on the basis of Schipske's sexual
orientation and because she has the support of Assemblymember
Sheila Kuehl, also a lesbian.  She falsely charges that Schipske's
sexual orientation will result in the candidate supporting a "radical" gay
rights agenda in the Assembly.
     The mailer has resulted in Los Angeles City Attorney James Hahn's
withdrawal of his support for Richardson.  He said, "I was deeply
disappointed when I saw your campaign mailer attacking your opponent.
Democrats are the party of inclusion; your blatantly anti-gay mailer has
no place in a democratic primary.  I therefore have no choice but to
withdraw my endorsement for your candidacy and repudiate your
message of hate.  Gerrie Schipske deserves my vote."  "This is clearly a 
last-ditch effort by a desperate candidate," said
Sky Johnson, Director of Public Policy for the Los Angeles Gay &amp;
Lesbian Community Services Center.  "We're urging Richardson's other
supporters, including teachers associations and Democratic clubs to
withdraw their support.  She has foolishly misjudged the intelligence of
Long Beach residents, and this last-ditch effort will backfire."

<b>UNITED STATES</b>
March 19 (USA Today) - MORE FOLKS SAY GAY IS O.K.
<br/>
The number of people who believe homosexuality is acceptable has gone
up 10 percentage points since 1982. But most people still don't approve of
same-sex marriages. In a USA TODAY / CNN / Gallup telephone poll of 1,008
adults conducted March 15-17, 44% said they thought homosexuality is
acceptable. A similar poll in 1992 showed that only 38% thought it
acceptable; in 1982 the number was 34%. However, the poll showed that 68%
of respondents think marriages between homosexuals shouldn't be recognized
by law or have the same benefits as traditional marriages. Only 27% said
such marriages should be valid. Margin of error for the poll was plus or
minus 5 percentage points.

<b>UNITED STATES/UTAH</b>: Feb. 12 --
In Utah we are experiencing a huge upsurge in the whole lesbian gay rights
realm.  A lesbian kid (of course!) at a local high school decided to form
what they are calling the "Gay/Straight Alliance" club.  The principal and
many teachers have been supportive, the principal wrote a letter to the
attorney general asking if there was any reason not to ok the club, and
waited for her (imagine that, in little old Utah we have a progressive
female AG) response, which was that constitutionally these kids can
have their clubs, before ok-ing the club.
<br/>
Then the Eagle Forum got a hold of it and raised hell.  A video called Gay
Rights/No Special Rights was annonymously delivered to several key
legislators.  Its a horrible anti-gay film, and they in turn held an
illegal "secret" meeting to discuss what to do legislatively about these gay
clubs at high schools.  The legislature (I think a requirment for
membership is an IQ less than 12) is trying to think of ways to ban these
clubs. Well, the outcry has been wonderful.  We had a rally last Tuesday 
at the capital that was loud and very powerful.  "Pete" the high schooler
whostarted this spoke eloquently, she is very articulate for a 17 year
old.  And Rachel, who is 16, and has been involved in a lawsuit over the 
chorus at another high school about singing Mormom songs (she's been on 
the national news and we, meaning Utah NOW, gave her a Woman of 
Courageous Action award 
ast year...I'm sure we'll give Pete an award this year), is forming a club 
at her high school, spoke.  I spoke, as did leaders of all the lesbian gay
focused groups, and ACLU and others. Lots of press.
<br/>
The socialists held a speak out on Friday night as they do every
month, and there are usually 20 people or so, there were over 200 folks
jammed into a little room at the YWCA.  I spoke at that, and on Saturday
night at our local DIG (Diversity is Great) awards dinner that honors
volunteers in the lesbian/gay community...I spoke a bit about the issue of
leabian/gay rights being a issue of the heart...that we are right.  Thats
how I keep on going in this negative political climate, we have right on
our side.  We are working for social justice and equality, and no one can
say that is wrong.  This IS a religious issue, and my religion does not
preach hate, and does not spread evil.  I'll get off my soap box.  Pete
won an award.  These high school kids are great.  Its takes alot of
courage
tocome out in Utah, much less to come out in high school.

This issue is bringing a lot of people together and a lot of straights as
well.  Next Sunday at my Unitarian church we are declaring our church a
"Hate Free Zone" and wrapping a giant red ribbon around the entire church.
The whole thing is now in the hands of the School Board who will decide
basically, whether or not to ban all non-academic clubs (which is what they
will do I think), to require parent's written permisson to join any
non-academic club, or to refuse all federal funding so they can ban ONLY
lesbian/gay clubs...can you believe they are considering turning down $200
million in federal funbds just so they can ban lesbian/gay student clubs?
And this is in the state that is dead last in the amount of money spent
per pupil.   The uproar will be loud, because whatever they do,
it won't be positive. Luci Malin Utah lmalin@sarek.osmre.gov

<b>UNITES STATES/MONTANA</b>: Feb. 20 --
At last! The Montana State Supreme Court declared unconstitutional
the law making homosexuality illegal last week! After 54 years, I
finally am legal! I confess I did nothing to help (overtly), but
felt I couldn't as a State employee.

IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHRISTIAN TO REJECT POLITICS OF HATE
<br/><br/>
By Jimmy Carter
<br/><br/>
It is admirable for Americans to promote our personal beliefs
through either religious or political processes. But when we
attempt to use our government to force others to worship as we
do or treat those who differ as secondary citizens, then we
violate the basic tenets of a democracy.
As a conservative Baptist, I am deeply concerned about divisive
arguments that have driven wedges between people. We Christians
can buttress our arguments on almost any subject with Biblescriptures and
then claim that our conclusions should be applied
universally. These attitudes can lead to condemnation or even
persecution of those who are different.
Beginning about 20 years ago, some Christian leaders concluded a
union with the more conservative wing of the Republican Party.
But even if the political marriage of fundamentalist Christians
had been with Democrats, this would have been a conflict with my
own belief in separation of church and state.
<br/>
Now leaders of the highly organized Christina right have
successfully injected into America's political debate some
divisive religious questions. The most vivid examples involve
sexual preferences, which obviously have highly personal and
emotional overtones. Tragically, these issues have moved to the
forefront of the 1996 presidential election scene.
Since almost all Protestants now condone divorce as an
acceptable way of life and rarely mention fornication oradultery, it is
much easier and more convenient for heterosexual
Christians to focus on Homosexuality, refusing to acknowledge
that this is a sin never mentioned by Jesus. From the New
Testament, it is clear that leaders of the early church treated
homosexual acts the same as fornication, adultery and many
transgressions. The apostle Paul makes it plain that homosexual
tendencies, along with many other temptations, should be
resisted: "Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." (I
Corinthians 6:9). Then he goes on to say that all these acts had
been totally forgiven. "And such were some of you' but you are
washed, but your are sanctified, but you are justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
<br/>
The driving issues in the early Republican primary contests have
been made a strange and disturbing shift from economic and
budget items to divisive social issues, notably abortion andmore extreme
religious activists have pushed almost every
candidate to demagoguery, emphasizing vicious attacks on gay men
and women ostensibly based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. An
even more disquieting claim is that AIDS is God's punishment on
someone who has sinned and that the sufferers should be treated
accordingly. Jesus had similar encounters with lepers, who were
also looked upon as condemned by God and capable of
contaminating their neighbors. Christ set an example for us by
reaching out to them, loving and healing them.
<br/>
Other Christians and the general public must not condone, even
by silence, these obnoxious attitudes, increasingly promoted
among a few demagogic religious and political leaders. In
addition to the direct punishment of many American citizens,
undisputed acceptance of a premise that originates within the
religious community tends to authenticate it among those who
have their own personal prejudices.
We must make it clear that a platform of "I hate gay men and
women" is not a way to become president of the United States.

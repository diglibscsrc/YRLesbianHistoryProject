<p>When I first visited southern Oregon in 1976, I fell in love with the landscape and the ways in which lesbians and other women were making homes and building community.</p>
<p> A wave of women immigrants had began moving to Southern Oregon in 1972. Some came as lesbians, some as single women, and some came partnered with men from whom they later separated. Beginning around 1969, the area had become a mecca for the back-to-the-land movement. Acreage was cheap. In one county, Josephine, building codes did not exist until 1974. Structures under 120 square feet (or 10x12 feet) still do not need a building permit.</p>
<p> There was easy access to major metropolitan areas via Interstate 5 which brought an ever changing group of explorers to and through the area. Women were drawn from all over the world by WomanSpirit magazine, a quarterly published between 1974 and 1984, and by Country Lesbians: The Story of the WomanShare Collective, a book published in 1976.</p>
<p> I was especially fascinated by the small houses women were living in. On that first trip, I took photographs of Ruth and Jean Mountaingrove standing in front of their tiny cabin at Golden, semi-communal land owned by gay men. Jean Mountaingrove refers to the building as a "tar paper shack." It had been rehabilitated from a mining cabin. Inside was a double bed mattress on the floor, a small wood-burning stove and a long, thin work table against the wall at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p> The buildings women created to serve their personal needs were tiny (smallest at Cabbage Lane), often post and beam construction although hexagons, yurts, and other forms were employed. Women also lived in tepees, modified school buses, converted chicken coops, and sheds.</p>
<p> Most of the woman-made buildings consisted initially of a single room 8x8 to 10x20 with a sleeping loft and a wood burning stove. Rarely did buildings have inside running water. Pit outhouses were the norm. In some cases these have been replaced by composting toilets. Outhouses were often roofed, open structures positioned with lovely views.</p>
<p> The buildings on communal lands were points of continuity. They were named: Moon House, Rattlesnake, Indigo, Madrone, The Sun House, Star, The White House, The Coop, Trillium. Since residents changed on a weekly or monthly basis on some of these lands, former residents frequently asked after the buildings rather than specific people who once had lived there.</p>
<p> Small cabins were easy to build and manage. They represented a negation of traditional womanly roles. They were not built to accommodate entertaining or childrearing. Often lovers lived in separate buildings thus reinforcing the autonomy and independence which were cornerstones of this community. In some cases, special buildings were constructed to house children. Community spaces—like the outdoor kitchen/dinning area at Cabbage Lane or the main houses at WomanShare or at OWL Farm-served to unite women. The outdoors was used for many gatherings and women often had outdoor beds for the dry, hot summers.</p>

<br/> Conceptually, collective rather than communal living, dominated. Women formed lose-sometimes anarchistic-affiliations. Rules were minimal, control decentralized.
      <p> Many buildings were idiosyncratic. One in particular had oddly placed windows. Different residents modified structures to fit their needs and personalities. Windows were added or covered up. Skylights were added, repaired, and repaired again. Porches were built, then covered, then enclosed. Decks were added, then sometimes moved or eliminated. Insulation was inserted into ceilings, walls or under floors.
      <p> Some lands housed many women, especially during the dry summer months. Others might have only one or two residents, but be the sites of group activities such as cultural or spiritual gatherings.
      <p> Safety, economy, and autonomy were major attractions of these lands. They gave women an inexpensive or rent-free way to explore new psychological and physical territories.
      <p> There was a desire to live lightly on Mother Earth and in sympathy with nature. Permanence was de-emphasized. Some buildings were constructed using four or six posts placed on large rocks. Sometimes posts were soaked in motor oil. Commercially treated wood was seldom used.
      <p> Initially, most buildings were not insulated. Alternative forms of insulation were tried including cardboard or egg cartons in combination with tin foil. Salvaged, scavenged and hand crafted materials were chosen, over new, store-bought wood, hinges, etc. Because interior space was at a premium, storage-such as winter or summer clothing-was sometimes done in large galvanized metal garbage cans.
      <p> It was a low tech community. Heavy machinery, which would disrupt the surface and contour of the land, ran counter to the dominate nature-friendly ideology, so innovative conservationist building styles, like berming the north side of buildings, were not used. Because of their high cost, double-pane insulated windows and solar cells were rarely used in the early years. Creative use was made of deep-cycle marine batteries and portable generators. Direct solar energy was used for heating water in summer, some baking, and to heat greenhouses which in turn moderated the heating and cooling of buildings.

<p> There were some health problems caused by primitive sanitation. Vegetarian menus, especially at group events, and the use of anti-bacterials such as Clorox rinses at outhouses, kept these problems from being worse than they might otherwise have been.
      <p> Not all of the small homes were in isolated rural areas. Among those who stayed in the area over a period of years, an active interchange took place between urban and rural activities.
      <p> The construction projects allowed women who had never held a hammer in their hands to learn new skills. Some continued learning and became professional carpenters. Larger structures were successfully completed.
      <p> This is now an aging community with women turning fifty and sixty in increasing numbers. Although there was a dramatic decrease in participation during and after the recession of the early 1980s, new women are being drawn to the area by articles in magazines like Maize: a Lesbian Country Journal and by workshops teaching cob building. Cob, which utilizes hay and mud is a newly repopularized form of low cost construction.
      <p> In a recent message, Carol Newhouse writes "so much of what you call the back to the land movement was about coming out, and coming into our power and identity as Lesbians. We intuitively knew we had to get out of the patriarchal cities, and re-define ourselves and our lives. We actually tried to build a new culture. Of course we had internalized a lot of the mainstream culture, and this always haunted us. But that is what I think it was about. Not back to the land, but back to ourselves. It was a spiritual experience for all of us I think, whether or not we used the word at the time. It was a healing, a rediscovery, and an affirmation." (e-mail, Sept. 15, 1998)
      <p> Two images stay with me as emblematic of housing on Southern Oregon Women's Lands. One is of Trillium, one of the smallest cabins at the communal land called Cabbage Lane. It impressed me with its coziness, its comfortingness, its sense of safety and security. It burned down in the late 1980s, before I could take pictures of it.
      <p> The other image is of Annie Ocean's van with its wood burning stove, smoke coming out of its chimney. For me, it symbolizes the mobility and ingenuity typical of the women who moved to and stayed in this area.

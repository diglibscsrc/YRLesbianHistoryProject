<p><font color="#000000" size="+1"> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">In 1972, Sisterhood founders Adele
Wallace, Simone Wallace and Gahan Kelley were already veterans of the
women's liberation movement. Through their work with the
L.A./Crenshaw Women's Center, they were no strangers to
consciousness-raising groups, demonstrations for equal pay and
reproductive rights, or the dozens of meetings that seemed to be
required to plan an event or put out a flyer by consensus.</font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">In the Crenshaw Center, Simone
recalls, "there was a room where we gathered books and articles sent
to us by women across the country. It was self-service; people put
their quarters in a metal box and took an article by Valerie Solanas
or Kate Millet." This room became more and more crowded as feminist
books and publications proliferated and, inspired by the news of the
opening of feminist bookstores in other cities, the three friends
decided to open a store in Los Angeles. With more political
conviction than business acumen, they opened a tiny storefront on
Westwood Boulevard just a few blocks south of their current location,
in November, 1972.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">"We opened the store and within
two weeks it seemed like everyone in the women's movement knew that
we were here and came to browse and shop." They came to read the
bulletin board, to check out the latest copies of feminist
newspapers, and to snap up copies of Robin Morgan's </font><em><font color="#000000" size="+1">Sisterhood is Powerful</font></em><font color="#000000" size="+1">, Simone DeBeauvoir's </font><em><font color="#000000" size="+1">The Second Sex</font></em><font color="#000000" size="+1">, and the Boston Women's Health Collective's
</font><em><font color="#000000" size="+1">Our Bodies, Our
Selves</font></em><font color="#000000" size="+1">. While books were
a vital part of their vision, the bookstore founders embraced the
whole of the emerging women's cultural production, stocking music and
posters, buttons and t-shirts and craft items.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">In April of 1973, Sisterhood moved
to its present location at 1351 Westwood Boulevard. In addition, from
1976-1979, the store maintained a branch in the Women's Building
downtown which often hosted gatherings of women writers as well as
visual artists. When UCLA launched its Women's Studies Department in
the late 1970s, Sisterhood started selling textbooks for classes, an
arrangement that continues to this day.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">Sisterhood founders were not
planning to stay in business for a quarter century. Simone says they
assumed "that the women's movement would take off and that after a
short time there wouldn't be a need for a separate women's bookstore
because 50% of the inventory of every bookstore would consist of
books by and about women; 51% of the art sections would reflect books
by woent artists; and 51% of the literature would be women's
literature. It seemed so obvious."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">In the twenty-five years that
Sisterhood has been in operation, the quality and variety of their
stock has expanded enormously. On the shelves one can find women's
books on topics as diverse as travel, health, literary criticism,
spirituality, science fiction, mystery, sports, poetry, lesbian
literature, biography, and books for children. In 1981, the store
doubled its space to accommodate the proliferation of new material.
"It used to be," Adele recalls, "that we would order any women's
title published. Now we have to pick and choose."</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">Sisterhood is also a vital center
for information and a place to experience the richness and diversity
of the women's community. The community resource room offers flyers
and brochures about the latest classes, dances, political actions and
cultural events. Staff frequently receive calls for referral help in
handling problems of rape, housing, and domestic violence. For
travelers to Los Angeles, Sisterhood is often the first stop for
information about this city's activities and resources for
women.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">Sisterhood Bookstore has also been
the host of many readings and book signings. Hundreds of women
writers and authors--from the internationally famous to the
just-emerging--have been greeted by an enthusiastic public. Alice
Walker, Lily Tomlin, Adrienne Rich, Angela Davis, Judy Chicago, and
Betty Friedan are just a few who have made </font><font color="#000000" size="+1"><a href="sistapp.html">appearances</a></font><font color="#000000" size="+1">.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">More than a few authors who later
went on to be publilshed by mainstream houses received their first
exposure at Sisterhood Bookstore, where their work was presented in
readings, and where their small-press or self-published books were
stocked. Such books would never appear on the shelves of the chain
bookstores, and for many emerging or marginalized writers, women's
bookstores like Sisterhood still provide the only forum for reaching
an audience. Women's bookstores have also played a major role in the
survival of feminist publishers. And by cultivating a community of
book buyers (known as a "market" among corporate publishers), women's
bookstores have influenced mainstream publishers to publish new books
for, by, and about women.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">With the rise of the mega-stores
and the chains, which often choose sites in close proximity to
long-established, independent booksellers, many women's bookstores
have faced serious financial threat, and a number of them have
closed. Sisterhood Bookstore--still run by two of its original
founders, former sisters-in-law Adele Wallace and Simone Wallace--is
one of the few remaining in Southern California.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="+1">Unlike the superstores, which are
motivated solely by profit, Sisterhood remains committed to fostering
the exchange of feminist ideas and culture, to providing an
environment that is safe and nurturing, and to facilitating the
struggle for equality and justice. Since the early days, the women's
community has grown in richness and diversity, and women's cultural
projects have increased in ambition, inventiveness, and number.
Sisterhood plans to be around to ensure that those creative
works--books and CDs, magazines and posters--reach a broad and
enthusiastic audience where they, in turn, may stimulate further
dialogue and inspire new visions.</font></p></blockquote>

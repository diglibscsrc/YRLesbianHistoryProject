<b> DYKE MARCH 1997: </b>
<br/>
Press release:
Lesbians from all
over
California
will gather at the park on the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Doheny
in West Hollywood on Saturday, June 21st, 1997 at 7 pm to rally and march
through the streets culminating in a lesbian - oriented street party.
<br/>
The 1996 Dyke March drew over 1500 women and organizers are projecting
to triple that number this year.  Similar marches in New York and San
Francisco have been known to draw 20,000 to 50,000 women respectively.

The Los Angeles Dyke March is a grassroots, volunteer - based
organization dedicated to all aspects of lesbian visibility and female
empowerment. We are currently accepting donations to pay for advertising
and other expenses.  Volunteer positions are also available.

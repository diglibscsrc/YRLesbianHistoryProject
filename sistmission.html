SISTERHOOD BOOKSTORE was founded in 1972 by three women active in the Los
Angeles movement for women's Iiberation. Two of the founders, Adele
Wallace and Simone Wallace. 
continue to own and operate the store with the support of an enthusiastic,
knowledgeable staff. The bookstore began as a gathering place and
distribution center for the phenomenal outpouring of books, magazines, and
artistic and political projects emerging from a heightened women's
consciousness. 
Sisterhood soon became the center for information, resources, and the
lively exchange of progressive ideas that it remains today. 
Throughout the liberal 70's, the conservative 80's, and the volatile 90's,
Sisterhood continues to be a rewarding haven for anyone who wishes to

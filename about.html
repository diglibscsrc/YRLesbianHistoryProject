<br>Website, 130+ HTML files</h4>
<p class="textAbout">
This source is a restoration of the Lesbian History Research Project (LHRP) website as it looked in 2005. More than a singular website, the LHRP was a universe of webpages that Retter created and maintained across various academic institutions to collect, preserve, and circulate the history of lesbian women. To Retter, the internet was a “goddess-sent” resource because, with minimal funding, an archive could make “lesbian history and the history of other sexual outlaws more accesible to people around the world.” A community endeavor, the LHRP relied on a vast network of collaborators to code pages, fix broken links, and submit original content through an ongoing open call. At the height of its popularity, the LHRP was featured in Lycos' "Top 5% Sites" in the LGBT category, due to its high-quality content, relevance, and worldwide reach. <br><br>

Legacy links have been replaced with their respective Internet Archive links when available.

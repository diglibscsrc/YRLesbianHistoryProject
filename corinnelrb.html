     As an artist, I have longed for lesbian-themed work and for
information
about lesbian artists, past and present. Recent publications have
begun--but only just begun--to fill the art historical void.
The most recent study is 
<b>Nell Blaine: Her Art and Life by Martica
Sawin </b>, a
lusciously produced volume with colorful, delightful images. Blaine
(1922-1996) was born in Virginia and moved to New York City to study with
Hans Hoffmann in 1942.  From her earliest years in New York, Blaine found
sympathetic, supportive friends among other artists and writers. She made
an early commitment to abstraction, but in the 1950s began working more
realistically. Her career moved smoothly through group and solo
exhibitions, residencies at artists' colonies, and critical attention.
<p>
        However, in 1959 she contracted bulbar-spinal polio. Treatment
included
five months in an iron lung and later extensive physical therapy. She
would
use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. In 1960 she resumed painting.
Jill Julius Matthews gives generous attention to Blaine's work,
but scant
details of romantic relationships with men or women. Blaine married in
1943, but the marriage was annulled in 1948. Lesbianism is never
approached
directly in the text. Blaine's friendship with (lesbian) poet May Swenson
is mentioned. In 1960, a young English nurse, Dilys Evans, became Blaine's
live-in companion, helper, and painting subject. When Evans had to return
to Britain because of her immigration status, Blaine went with her. They
stayed in a house loaned to them by a man who at one time had been W.H.
Auden's secretary. Blaine was distraught when Evans left in 1966, but
within a few months Carolyn Harris entered her life and stayed for the
next
twenty-nine years.
<p>
        I was alerted to the relationship between Blaine and Harris
through a
mention in New York Times obituary for the artist, for which I am
grateful.
Knowledge of Harris's presence in Blaine's life opens up the possibility
for a lesbian reading of some of the work. Harris is the subject of
paintings and photographs, but I also imagine her picking flowers which
appear in many still lifes. There is an intimacy in images of tables set
for two. And were views through windows especially cherished because the
couple had looked through them together?
<p>   
     In <b> Working Light: The Wandering Life of Photographer Edith S.
Watson </b>,
the
relationships are much clearer. This may be because less is at stake:
Watson (1860-1943)--obscure even at the end of her life--has been dead
more
than five decades. Author Frances Rooney, a lesbian writer who cares
deeply
about the reclaiming of lesbian history, spent years searching out
information about the photographer and her lover. Watson was born and
raised in the United States. Initially a painter, by the 1890s she was
traveling around the eastern seaboard states and across Canada, supplying
photographs to magazines, newspapers, books, and business establishments.
Bermuda writer Victoria Hayward was her companion for the last 32 years of
her life.
<p>
        Certain images will resonate with lesbian audiences. In one,
Hayward
stands at the water's edge in Nassau in 1916. Although dressed in proper
garb of hat, jacket, and long skirt, her feet are bare and her dress is
held up revealing her thighs and an edge of underwear. In another, Hayward
stands centered on a gravel road in the middle distance. Her back is
turned
to the photographer who has hung back to take the picture, but will soon
join her on their walk. Beyond Hayward is the sensual sweep of mountains,
the erotic lacy outlines of conifer trees. I know that kind of road, that
focusing on the beloved, recording an intensely felt place and time.
<p>
<b> Borrowed Time: Photographs by Caroline Vaughan </b> (born in
1949)
brings us
exquisitely into the present. On the cover, two nude women crawl across a
rocky slope in a southwestern landscape, their bodies white against the
dark formation. Dry grass grows in pubic clumps. The vista is
breathtaking.
The delicate outline of mountains undulates along the horizon. Could
someone tell from the text that the photographer is a lesbian? No. But
many
of the photos carry hints. Along with images of male transvestites and men
who appear to be lovers, are paired images of women vulnerable to each
other and to the viewer, images in which women embrace with ferocious
tenderness. In one a woman with a mastectomy holds her hand in a shielding
gesture, as if to protect her lover from pain.
        Eros is present in flowers which touch each other, in the fall of
water
clothed, seeming to pray or meditate beneath a rod hung with clothes
hangers, their shadows almost menacing her head.
        I asked Caroline Vaughan if she identified as lesbian. She said
she prefers the word "gay."
<p>        
Honor Moore is a respected lesbian feminist writer. <b> The White
Blackbird: A
Life of the Painter Margarett Sargent </b> is Moore's study of her
outrageous,
talented, bisexual grandmother. Sargent (1892-1978) was born to privilege
and married well. She traveled extensively, raised four children and had
affairs with men and women. Her portraits are lively and moody and her
drawings have a jittery, almost disconcerting power. The bisexual writer
Jane Bowles, who was one of Sargent's lovers, is pictured with wild hair
and compelling eyes. Lesbian Isabel Pell, hair cropped and wearing pants,
is drawn with an appreciation of butchy women. In Paris in 1928, Sargent
commissioned a portrait from lesbian photographer Berenice Abbott. The
image is of an almost grimly serious young woman of whom Abbott later
said,
"Paris was a magnet for a woman like that, looking for freedom." (p.182)
        Alcoholism fogged Sargent's life and stole much of her pleasure
and
talent. Were it not for Moore's sleuthing, Sargent's life and work would
have been lost.
<p>
<b>  Damn Fine Art by New Lesbian Artists </b> is lesbian cultural
critic
Cherry
Smyth's Who's Who of contemporary lesbian painters, sculptors, and
photographers. It is a lively overview featuring many individuals--from
several different countries--whose work might be termed "edgy." Fifty
artists are treated sequentially in a kind of virtuoso word painting. The
tone of the book favors urban, snarly imagery, although not all of the
artists fit this profile. Smith--Irish and former co-programmer of the
London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival--was initially attracted to the book
project as a way to explore the emergence of "queer" art by lesbians.
Although she broadened the scope to include lyrical realist painters like
Lenore Chinn, confrontational images like Della Grace's self-portrait
rimming her lover will cling to many viewer's minds.
<p>
<b> In Lesbian Art: An Encounter With Power </b>, Elizabeth Ashburn
positions
lesbian art within English language lesbian feminist writing and history.
Ashburn is an openly lesbian college professor and Head of the School of
Art, University of New South Wales. The artists featured in her book are
all Australian, but the visual and written dialogue crosses borders of
national identity. More than any other survey book (and there have been
fewenough of them to date), Lesbian Art seems to encompass a broad
spectrum of imagery, from in-your-face dildo waving pictures, to
visualizations of
lesbian motherhood, old gay butch, and various levels of abstraction.
Styles swing between romantic, postmodern, and grunge. The images have
that
extra haunting quality which draws the viewer back to find new layers of
richness in the graphics and the words. Of special note are Tina Fiveash's
hilarious spoofs of domestic advertising.
<p>
<b> Sex In Public: Australian Sexual Cultures </b>, edited by Jill Julius
Matthews,
contains thirteen essays, two of which deal with lesbian visual art:
C.Moore Hardy's "Lesbian erotica and impossible images" and Elizabeth
Ashburn's "Stirred heart and soul: the visual representation of lesbian
sexuality." Ashburn, after a brief overview, examines the work of Marion
Moore and Suzanne Boccalatte, both featured in Lesbian Art: An Encounter
With Power. Moore's studies of lesbian mothers and of women who identify
as
butch are especially complex and intriguing. In her essay, C. Moore Hardy
(born in 1955) discusses the development of her lesbian-identified
photographic work. During the past ten years, she has moved from producing
images which she feels were confined by feminist theory, to documenting
(asa voyeur) s/m performance and bondage scenes, to explorations of other
forms of lesbian erotica. She has a gift for catching and/or creating
memorable pictures.
<p>   
     How did these books come to be created and published? Bloodline
and
perhaps the affinity of creativity rescued Margarett Sargent's work. The
lure of lesbian history, repairing the discontinuity of knowledge of our
collective past drew Frances Rooney to Edith Watson. Local appreciation of
her work created the impetus for a book of Caroline Vaughan's images. The
need to reflect a youthful cosmopolitan stance motivated Cherry Smyth.
Professional training combined with lesbian self-awareness informed
Elizabeth Ashburn's study. If there is a theme here it is that there needs
to be a willingness to be honest, and that willingness, when found in a
lesbian artist or researcher, produces books which reflect a lesbian
aesthetic.
<p>
To whom would this kind of biography and iconography be important?
I hope
to the kind woman who reads The Lesbian Review of Books, but I think that
lesbian art in general is still looking for its audience. Unlike gay male
art, galleries have not developed to support openly sapphic work.
Feminist,lesbian, and gay periodicals and books are the primary
way--almost the only
way--that lesbian artists can interact with an interested national and
international public.

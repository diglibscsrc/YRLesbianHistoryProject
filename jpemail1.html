<b>Comments:</b> Dear Grace: I feel deep sympathy for your loss of Johnnie as your life companion. I know her presence with you was a huge part of your soul's joy and expression in the world. Her foibles, her stubbornness, her unique, no bullshit, cut to the chase style of interacting was just a part of why so many of us who knew her felt honored to do so. Although she and I were in each others calendars only intermittently, I felt richer in my life for knowing her and whenever I thought of her it always made me smile. She was such an enigma, she pulled no punches, tolerated no insincerities and was extraordinarily loyal to her causes and her friends. To me, Johnnie lived by the motto "If you're not making waves, you're not kicking hard enough." I know that wherever she is now in this vast sea of space she's definately still making waves.

<b>Comments:</b> Grace, You and johnnie were two people that I could always count on. My deepest sympathy at this time. Johnnie is in a beeter place now and maybe she can keep a better eye on me.

<b> Comments:</b> I worked with Johnnie on NOW publications for years. NOW had a policy of using only union printers and we were always pointing out that printers like Johnnie couldn't be in a union because of discriminatory policies against women and that we needed to change the union only policy to give feminists priority for bidding jobs (our own brand of affirmative action). Johnnie was a good ally to have and Toni, LA NOW, and activists on the side of the angels could always count on Johnnie to be a willing fighter against all odds. She could take it on the chin, smile, and come back at cha. Johnnie, I'll miss you.

<b> Comments:</b> I never had the pleasure of meeting Johnnie, however I did have the chance to meet some of the people she touched. What I know of Johnnie she was a kind hearted, caring lady, who donated her life to helping others. To those who didn't know her, she may not be here helping fight for what we all believe in but I know she is above fighting for us all there. Johnnie is and always will be an inspiration to me and all of us for what she believed in and what she stood for. God Bless you. Johnnie You were the one who held your head high. You saw what was not what could be. You were there for Grace and all. You led the way. You will be missed. Now it's time for you to be free.

<b>Comments:</b> Johnnie was from the very beginning a take-no-prisoners, no-holds barred friend. She brooked no nonsense and certainly did not suffer fools lightly. She was totally unlike anyone I'd ever met before. She was a power point, a center to each activity on which she turned her attention. She held herself as an example that amazing things can happen if you just set your mind to it. She was magnetic. I found that I would watch her and listen to her stories with great attention. She inspired great loyalties and great frustrations. Leaders do that. And lead she did; always at the head of the parade; stepping out in front to support what she believed in. Fire, passion, insight and a mixed bag of foibles - that was the Johnnie I knew. She was a special friend who gave subtle, special gifts and I will miss her greatly.

<b>Comments:</b> I feel lucky to have been a part of documenting Johnnie's recollections of her life. I am glad that what she stood for and lived for will be immortalized for all those who weren't able to meet her in person. It was an honor for me to have spent time with some one who unselfishly has done so much for a community that has too long been misrepresented, misunderstood, and condemned. Johnnie, you will be missed, but your life has given so many others a foundation on which to build. Thank you.

<b>Comments:</b> I came to the site because of a posting on H-Minerva. Johnie sounded like an interesting woman and I wanted to learn more about her. Her photos inspired me to leave a message. It's strange. It's like she spoke to me through those photos. I can well imagine she was an extraordinary woman whose loss will be deeply felt. Please accept the heart felt condolences of this stranger.

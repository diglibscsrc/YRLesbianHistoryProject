<b> * WHO WE ARE</b>
<br/>
SCWU was founded in 1976 in Los Angeles. We are lesbians from all walks
of life who seek in SCWU a common
denominator in educational functions. We are lesbians who want a safe
place to share our strengths, concerns, cultural diversity, and resources
with each other, and who seek in SCWU support for our lifestyles. Our
membership is composed of women who value and contribute to the community.
Our aim is to eradicate negative stereotypical images of lesbians by
example and through positive educational programs about our concerns,
issues and lives. Our mission is to empower lesbians to achieve their
potential.

<b>Russians claim to unearth steppes' ancient Amazons - (James Meek) 
</b>
<p>
The Guardian, 11/23/98
<p>
The theory that parts of ancient eastern Europe were patrolled by posses
of heavily armed women akin to the
legendary Amazon warriors has been boosted by new evidence uncovered by
Russian scientists. 
<p>
A team of archaeologists investigating 2,400-year-old burial mounds built
by the Scythian people on the upper
River Don has found that five of twenty-one graves contained the bodies of
young women with their weapons.
<p>
"Usually such women are found in large kurgans [Scythian burial mounds],
buried with the same rituals as for
men," said Valery Gulyayev of the Russian Institute of Archaeology in
Moscow, who leads annual digs near
the city of Voronezh.
<p>
"They are buried with womanly things - mirrors of silver and bronze;
necklaces of gold, glass or clay; earrings;
and sometimes a symbolic spindle," Dr Gulyayev said. "But alongside these
are weapons - a quiver, bow and
arrows, and often two throwing spears."
<p>
At roughly the same time the Scythian women were being buried, the Greek
historian Herodotus described how
a mythical race of women warriors, the Amazons, had left their homeland on
the south shores of the Black Sea,
travelled north, taken husbands among the local males and founded a new
society.
<p>
Herodotus's tales of Amazons of the steppes in what is now Ukraine and
southern Russia had been dismissed
as fantasy. But the Voronezh discoveries, the first of their kind on the
northern edge of Scythian settlement,
add to older finds in Ukraine, the lower Don and the Ukok plateau near
Mongolia.
<p>
They indicate a swath of sister cultures stretching from Hungary to China,
which shared a love of gold and
horses, and relationships that differed sharply from the male-dominated
society of their neighbouring
contemporaries, the ancient Greeks.
<p>
"We have a fixed idea that European civilisation was built on Greco-Roman
foundations," Dr Gulyayev said.
"In a sense, this is fair. But if we ignore the fact that in the West and
in the East two large, so-called barbarian
cultures, the Celts and the Scythians, made an enormous contribution to
ancient Europe, we fail to see the
whole picture."
<p>
Debate about the role of the women warriors of ancient Ukraine and Russia
has intensified lately as the
long-divided archaeological cultures of the Soviet and Western worlds
begin to mesh.
<p>
Contemporary Greek accounts of military clashes do not mention women on
the battlefield. Modern writers
have suggested that closer examination of the "female" skeletons may prove
them to be transvestites.
<p>
Dr Gulyayev's theory is far from the bloodthirsty picture painted by
Herodotus, who said virgin Amazons were
not permitted to marry until they had killed a man in battle.
<p>
"Yes, there probably was an obligation on the women to serve as warriors,"
he said. "But it seems likely that
when the men left the settlements to pasture their herds, they left the
women on guard. These young women
and girls on horseback were in the role of lightly armed troops. They were
guarding the hearth and the
homestead."
<p>
The tombs being excavated by Dr Gulyayev's team were originally inside
kurgans. The dead were buried in
high chambers, with their possessions and weapons gilded, beside an
amphora of Greek wine, foal meat and
an iron knife.
<p>
Most of the graves were plundered long ago, but last year the team found
an untouched burial chamber
containing the skeleton of a man and an old woman of high status, who, at
the time of death, was severely
disabled and unable to eat solid food.
<p>
The woman, who had traces of rouge on her face and left fragments of face
powder on her mirror, wore solid
gold earrings with gold panthers hanging from them and had a chain of
gold-foil boars across her shoulders.
The man had dozens of tiny gold-foil horses scattered across him.
<p>
Working with meagre resources, Dr Gulyayev's team are racing to excavate
kurgans in the region before
intensive farming and building destroy them.
<p>
"All the kurgans are on ploughable black earth. I've seen kurgans
three
metres high just vanish," Dr Gulyayev
said. "If we don't excavate them now, then in a few years they'll
disappear.
<p>
"Our aim now is to get the money by any means and from any source - apart
from criminal - to get these graves
investigated."

Soviet archaeologists have long been tantalized by the huge mounds of
earth outside the town of Ordzhonikidze in
the southern Ukraine. But it was only when soviet planners also began
eying the region for its manganese deposits
that the archaeologists acted to satisfy their curiosity about one
particular site standing in the possible path of the
bulldozers. What the archaeologists found there exceeded their most
extravagant expectations. For the first time in
more than half a century, diggers uncovered an unlooted royal tomb of the
fabled Scythian tribesmen who roamed
and ruled great areas of the Russian heartland more than 2,000 years ago. 
<p>
The Scythians left behind no written record when they finally vanished
from the steppes in the 2nd century B.C.,
victims of intermarriage and conquest. But there was no end of legends
about their ferocity in battle and their great
troves of gold. The Greek historian Herodotus devoted more than half a
volume to them. Still, it was not until the
19th century, when archaeologists began serious studies of the puzzling
remains found scattered from the borders
of China to the banks of the Dniester, that scholars would admit there
might be more than a shard of truth to the
old Scythian tales. 
<p>
Now, the discovery of the royal tomb, which contains the skeletons of a
prince, a princess and an infant-as well as
other recent digs in the U.S.S.R.-gives the old stories the ring of
historical fact. Herodotus tells, for instance, how
the Scythians beheaded their fallen enemies and brought the skulls back to
camp to use as wine goblets
.
<p>
Archaeologist Renate Rolle, a young West German woman and the first
Western scientist allowed to participate in
a Soviet dig since 1920, reports that there is new evidence of Scythian
ferociousness. Lances and bows and
arrows found in graves along with female skeletons and ornaments suggest
that the Scythan women fought beside
their men. Thus Herodotus may well have been correct when he said that
bloodthirsty Scythian Amazons had to
kill a man in battle before they were allowed to marry. 
<p>
Stich Job - The Scythians were not always preoccupied with war. Besides
tippling, they apparently liked
tripping. Ancient bronze vessels found in Scythian graves in the Altai
mountins near China and Mongolia, still
contain remnants of the nomads favorite hemp seeds. They were also highly
successful herdsmen and farmers
who traded their grain to indulge their taste for expensive jewelry, such
as a magnificent gold pectoral ornament
recovered from the new-found grave in the Ukraine. Crafted by Greek
goldsmiths, who probably lived among the
Scythians along the Black Sea, the chestpiece contains no fewer than 44
exquisitely carved animals. Amoung
them; such fantasy creatures as the griffin, which has the head, wings and
forelegs of an eagle and the body of a
lion. 
<p>
Like the Egyptian pharaohs, Scythian rulers believed in taking their
worldly goods with them. Their graves contain
not only necklaces, rings and the small golden plaques that they fastened
onto their garments, but also household
implements, horses and even the remains of faithful servants. In one case,
the fingers of a less richly adorned
skeleton actually seemed to be clawing the ground. The telltale fingers
lend credence to Herodotus' statement that
servants were strangled in the grave, thus giving them the honor of
serving their masters in the next world.
<p>
Archaeologists also found scalped remains of Scythian enemies in frigid
Altai graves, but those trophies were
apparently not buried in any vengeful spirit. To spare their victims the
indignity of a scalpless afterlife, the
Scythians had painstakingly stiched hair back on.

        "My life has been nothing special. I am a quiet person who came from a very ordinary, middle-class Negro family. I was born July 23, 1899, in Springfield, Illinois... After high school in Springfield, a neighborhood man taught me how to set type and run
        his presses... I had one real girlfriend. Her name was Ceciline. We called her Babe. She was the only person I ever lived with... We lived together for 30 years... When I decided to have a [print] shop of my own, my girlfriend and I bought
        a home... Our house was noted for being a 'gay spot.' There weren't very many places in Detroit you could go back in 1937, 1940... people used to come from every place... Babe died in 1973... I love to dance, bowl, and go to classical music recitals. I have so many young friends who treat me wonderfully... I'm having a lot of fun!"</p>

            "I printed anything small, not books or things like that where it had to be linotyped. I did all printing by hand... I called [my shop] 'Ellis and Franklin Printing Company.' I didn't have any help either. That's why I refused a lot of jobs because it
            was too much for me. I wasn't going to have it run me crazy. I would just take the walk-in trade."

            "I saw this woman dancing, and I was wondering how old she was. I got tired and sat down, she was still dancing. I got some water and she was still dancing... I found out she was 97."

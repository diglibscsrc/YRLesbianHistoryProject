<h2> LESBIAN PHOTOGRAPHERS <br/> AND WOMEN WHO PHOTOGRAPHED LESBIANS </h2>

<br/> Los Angeles Dyke March, 1997.
      <p> "The lack of a publicly accessible history is a devastating form of oppression. Lesbians face it constantly. The impact of this on art is that lines of development are obscured, broken, sometimes destroyed beyond reconstruction. We cannot casually go into a library, look up lesbian aesthetics or lesbian photography, and find a body of aesthetics or lesbian photography, and find a body of knowledge, a list of artists, or descriptions of masterpieces" (Tee Corinne).
      <p> This site owes much to the work of Tee Corinne who has tirelessly researched this area and is now working on a book about lesbian photographers.
      <p>
<b>Project: Do you collect vintage/old photos of lesbians and lesbian-like women? <br/> I am working on a project to create a database of our lost herstory in these photographs. <br/> If you would like to be part of this project, please contact me at yretter@chicano.ucla.edu </b>

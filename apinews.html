JAPAN - BOOK SHEDS LIGHT ON LIVES OF JAPANESE LESBIANS
<p>
By Kishiko Saito
Mainichi Shimbun
<p>
A daring book has come out of the closet with 18 women telling
about how they fell in love with people who just happened to be
other women.
     <p>"Kanojotachi No Ai Shikata," which bears the English subtitle,
"Bye, Bye Sexuality" [Tokyo: The Massada, 1997; 1400 yen], not
only contains the tales of women who love other women, but
also includes the real names and photographs in a very rare
case in which gay women have gone public.
     The book is authored by Toro Kitao and the photographs are
attributed to Kangoro Nagakawa.
     Both of the book's creators are heterosexual men in their 40s.
     <p>They may thus seem far from the world of their subjects, but
a chance encounter in 1995 with a 22-year old woman, a popular
figure in the gay community of Tokyo's Shinjuku 2-chome,sparked their
The two assert that hey were interested in lesbians from the
beginning.
     But the young woman captivated them as she faced the camera
and spoke to them with an immediacy.
     They wondered where the woman's charisma came from.
     The two remember losing themselves in her story, when she
insisted on telling it.
    <p> They felt that it must have come as a shock to her to
realize that she was attracted to other women at the age
of 15 and sympathized with the strength it must have took
to come to terms with that. They came to admire her as a
woman who came to accept her sexual orientation despite
being unable to discuss it with others.
     "I admitted to myself that I had homosexual tendencies
when I was about 15, and I was definitely shook up," she
says. "Without being able to turn to anyone else for
advice, I was finally accepted by a woman who was able to
deal with my wounds."
 <p>She since introduced her friends and other similar mindedacquaintances
to
the pair.
     A year later, the anthology of their stories became a
concrete concept, and six couples and six other individuals
gave permission for their real names and photographs to
be used in the book.
     <p>Among those who give frank accounts of their stories are a
29-year-old woman who had married but initiated a divorce
because she was unable to love her husband and a couple
in their early 20s who went to the United States to make
preparations for marriage.
Some of those who had given up on the idea of marrying a
man have found themselves under the economic pressure to
support themselves.
     <p>Furthermore, lesbians who work for companies and come out
of the closet seem to face even harsher stigma than their
male counterparts.
     "I can't really presume to say that I understood everything,
but I wanted to convey something of the power thattranscends their pain,"
says Kitao. "I hope this book
can be an encouragement to people who are sufferingbecause they have been
unable to confide in anyone about
their homosexuality."
     <p>Photographer Nakagawa seems to share his colleague's
compassion. "I was ashamed to learn that I looked at
homosexuals as some sort of alien. In (the process of his
work), I felt my real nature experienced a 'coming out'."
     Meanwhile, the reader is tantalized by how women
themselves decided to "come out" in the book.
     <p>Says one 27-year-old, "It's not like I feel especially
guilty like I have to hide something. I am who I am.I felt that someone
like Toro could write about our
real feelings."
     <p>"I've been asked many things by many people," says a 24-
year-old woman, "but now I can say, 'Here's the book,
read it. Everything is explained here.'"
     <p>For her, the book is an all-purpose apologia to turn
over to the curious. Kitao and Nagakawa say that many of the women adopted
hardened, cynical attitudes when the pair visited them.
     They seemed to have grown hardened shells in response
to both the prurient interest and discrimination ofsociety.
     <p>But says one of the women, "The two unexpectedly
really listened to what I had to say. I was able to
confirm myself while speaking with them, and I was
happy that there are people who understand."
     <p>Maybe the book won't make a dent on society, but the
woman says she would be glad if at least people could
realize that there are many ways of expressing love
in this world.
   <p>  While Kitao wanted to create a frank document of what
the women were thinking while using their real names,
he still has misgivings as he sees the book boldly
displayed in book shop windows.
   <p>  Real names, however, have not been used in this
article, as Kitao and some of the women felt thattheir use in a
mass-circulation newspaper could be
embarrassing for their families.'

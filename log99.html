<b>CANADA</b> -
The deputy mayor of Richmond Hill, Ontario (located just north of
Toronto with a population of 80,000) is an open lesbian, Xtra!
reported Oct. 21.
Janet Mabley, 44, told the paper: "I'm not perfect, but being out
and being deputy mayor shows younger people that it's okay to be
yourself. It's important to be out because there is nothing to be
ashamed of.
"I advise others to be true to yourself, to be honest with
yourself. I'm much happier than I have been in years and years.
It might be cliche, but there's nothing queer about loving
someone."
Mabley plans to run for mayor in November 2000 (R. Wockner).

<b>COLOMBIA - </b>

care plan, grants homosexuals "liberty of association and

<b>ENGLAND</b> - Two London gay millionaires have paid a California woman
$320,000
to carry and deliver their twin babies, conceived with a mix of
their sperm and another woman's eggs, and then implanted into the
surrogate mother, reported the British magazine Woman's Own.
The gay couple, Barrie Drewitt, 30, and Tony Barlow, 35, said the
babies carried by Rosalind Bellamy will be born in December and
transported to a luxury nursery at their Chelmsford home. The boy
and girl will be named Aspen and Saffron.
Drewitt told Woman's Own: "We are bound to be criticised
because we are gay. But plenty of heterosexual people become
parents by mistake and don't even want a child. We're in a long-
term stable relationship and we have a strong extended family.
Nobody can ever say that these children are not wanted. The kids
will be loved as much as any other and perhaps more than quite a few."

<b>FIJI</b> -
Fiji's first gay group, the Sexual Minorities Project, has formed
under the auspices of the organization Women's Action for Change.
Coordinator Trisa Cheer has sent out a call for information
on "the study of whether being gay is genetic or not."
"At the moment there has been quite a debate in our country about
it," she said. "But without actual facts we, the sexual
minorities, cannot really argue with them. A whole page in one of
our newspapers, The Fiji Times, featured a psychiatrist who is
the medical superintendent of our mental hospital [who] says that
we can be saved, and I quote: 'I have helped boys and girls who
think they have homosexual tendencies and rescued them from such
ideas. ... It's become a fad now. That the in thing to be now is
gay.' Comments like these in our dailies do not help in our work
because we are already having to deal with culture and religion
which is hard enough as it is."
To assist the organization, write, Trisa Cheer, Coordinator,
Sexual Minorities Project, Women's Action for Change, P.O. Box2398, Suva,
Fiji. Phone 011-679-314363. Fax 011-679-305033. E-

About 150 people are expected to attend Sri Lanka's first
national lesbian convention in December.
The event is being planned by a group of women in Colombo who
have been meeting at the offices of the gay-male group Companions
on a Journey.
"Lesbians are generally accepted by society if they are
financially independent and come from upper-middle-class
backgrounds," one of the organizers, Tami, told Agence France-
Presse. "It is when they are less independent that they suffer
all sorts of problems from their homes and at work. It is such
people we want to help. Maybe help them to get better jobs and
also feel that they are not alone." (Rex Wockner).

<b>NEW ZEALAND </b> - 
Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said Aug. 4 that she
expects the nation to legally recognize same-sex partnerships
within two years, including granting the right to adopt children.

"This country has to face up both in law and reality to [same-
sex] relationships. We have to talk about this and manage and
accept it in law. ... This should not be a political issue."
However, Shipley does not support opening up marriage itself to
gay couples, she said. (Rex Wockner).

<b> IRELAND </b> - Irish lesbians have erected billboards in Dublin, Cork,
Galway, 
Limerick, Belfast and Derry advertising a helpline and urging
parents to accept their lesbian daughters.
The project was funded by the European Union's New Opportunities
for Women program.
"It's a visibility campaign that's about trying to encourage some
thought for those who are lesbian and their families," said Anita
Thoma of the Lesbian Education and Awareness group.
Speaking to Cork's Examiner newspaper, Thoma said: "There are
huge issues for anyone who is lesbian. We still have people
trying to lead double lives and no human being should have to do
that. ... Lesbians are your sister, your aunt, your shopkeeper,
your taxi driver, so it's about all kinds of relationships in
society." (Rex Wockner)
